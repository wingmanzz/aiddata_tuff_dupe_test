Chairman Punjab Board of Investment and Trade Sardar Tanveer in an interview the other day said negotiations with the Chinese company are currently underway for the execution of this important project. Given the importance of the project for the lives of the people, we expect that the talks will be concluded with the Chinese company at the earliest in order to ensure its early implementation. Previous Punjab government had also initiated some important projects vis-\u00e0-vis clean drinking water and waste management in Lahore and some other cities. However, as the metropolitan city has expanded its boundaries to its allied districts, it is important that the civic facilities are also expanded at the new settlements. In fact there is a need to establish an entirely new and modern waste management system in Lahore as well as other main cities of Punjab and then expanding the same to other cities including the rural areas. This is also in line with the vision and manifesto of PTI government and to realize this, federal and provincial governments can secure assistance and cooperation from the Chinese friends. To ensure sustainability of such projects, it is important that the relevant authorities also collect a fixed amount every month from the citizens for provision of these civic necessities. Together we can make our cities and towns cleaner and greener which will also protect our population from diseases as well as the natural disasters.", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPKOB", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1561456659000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585477544854, "region_codes": ",china,laho,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1561420800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
