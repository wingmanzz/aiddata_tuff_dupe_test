At present, Stage-I of the project is underway, while electricity generation from the project is expected to commence in 2024-25. Stage-I will contribute more than 12 billion units per annum to the National Grid. The Stage-II will also provide another 9 billion units to the system every year.\n\nThe World Bank is partially providing funds for construction of the Stage-I of Dasu Hydropower Project to the tune of US $ 588. 4 million and Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) of US $ 460 million.
