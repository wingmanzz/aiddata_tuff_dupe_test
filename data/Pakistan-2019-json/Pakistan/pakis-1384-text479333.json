Limited, alongside Oracle and PowerChina International Group Limited (\"PowerChina\").Accordingly, with the new consortium of equity partners identified, the Company's principal focus will now be the completion of work as outlined in the operational update (as announced on 17 January 2019) to reach financial close. Many of these operational items are procedural and, accordingly, the Company believes the process will be expedited by having senior management based primarily in-country to handle day-to-day operations.The Board has therefore appointed Ms Naheed Memon as an Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer, moving from her role as a Non-Executive Director, to manage the delivery of the Thar project on the ground in Pakistan. Ms Memon has first hand experience of the steps required for project completion following her previous role as Chair of the Sindh Board of Investment (Government of Sindh).Shahrukh Khan will remain as an Executive Director of the Company and will continue to assist in the development of the Thar project as it moves towards financial close, whilst also providing a presence in the UK and Europe to further increase the awareness of the Oracle investment case.Mark Steed, Chairman of Oracle said : \"This fresh assignment of duties will ensure the Oracle Board is best positioned to monitor and subsequently execute the steps required to bring the Thar project to financial close. Shahrukh Khan has done a remarkable job in developing Oracle to its current position. He has built a solid foundation for the Company and will continue to be instrumental in setting strategy and working with Ms Naheed Memon.", "subject_codes": ",ccat,c411,c41,ncat,nfact,nfcpex,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "DTMNTR", "industry_codes": ",i1,i16,i16101,i1610108,ieutil,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1548752751000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585478869995, "region_codes": ",pakis,uk,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,eecz,eurz,indsubz,sasiaz,weurz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1548633600000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",jingng,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
