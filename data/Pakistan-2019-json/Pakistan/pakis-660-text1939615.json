'Earlier residents of Lahore had to travel to Islamabad to apply for a visa to China,' he said, 'This new place will provide enormous relief to businessmen and visitors. Lahore is an important city and the new hub of economic activity in Punjab.'\n\nThe visa center in Lahore will handle ordinary visa applications to China, to the special administrative region of Hong Kong and Macao. However, the final approval will still be granted by the Chinese embassy in Islamabad. The Lahore office will only collect the needful documents and forward the requests.\n\nThe Chinese 'embassy will not operate the visa center in Lahore directly. It has outsourced it to a private company,' Zhengwu added.\n\nApproximately 4,000 applications are processed by China's embassy in Islamabad per month.", "subject_codes": ",cprdop,c24,ccat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASBEXP", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1569501865000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585483242304, "region_codes": ",china,laho,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1569196800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
