He said Pakistan made unprecedented development in 1960s as several dams were constructed in that period.\n\nPrime Minister said the country will be made a true welfare Islamic state on the pattern of the state of Medina which was based on justice and equality.\n\nHe said the country will be developed on the style of China which has always made long term development planning. Imran Khan said the country was pushed into backwardness due to corruption by the ruling elite in past. He said the national resources will be spent on public welfare.\n\nImran Khan said all the provinces will give three percent of their share in National Finance Commission for development of the tribal people during next ten years.\n\nHe announced that four and a half billion rupees will be spent on the development of Mohmand district alone.

The premier reiterated the resolve to help the nation overcome water scarcity.\n\n'Water crisis persists nationwide and it is linked to the construction of dams,' he said. PM Imran Khan called out former heads of the states for not showing commitment towards the cause.\n\n'Dams are not built due to fear of elections,' he added, implying that construction of dams outlives a single democratic government's tenure due to which former rules did not pursue the matter at all.\n\nThe prime minister elaborated that former governments were 'selective' in serving their people because they only performed as much as it took to strengthen their vote bank.\n\n'Balochistan and the tribal districts should not have been neglected for constituting a smaller portion of the vote bank,' he continued, recounting that the development fund allocated to Punjab was mammoth as opposed to the rest of the country.\n\nOn the ongoing China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the premier maintained that it was a ray of hope for the country.

'China doesn't think merely of elections,' he continued.\n\nHe said that China has about 5,000 dams as big as Tarbela and Mangla in Pakistan, and that there is a reason why China has been building so many dams.\n\nHe maintained that China has decided to help Pakistan, and with the use of advanced technology and techniques, the dam could be built in less than five years of time.\n\nHe stated that we [the government] have to built five million houses in the country, and not one city but the entire state would be uplifted\n\nFor Mohmand district, he said Rs4.5 billion has been allocated for the development of the region.\n\nRegarding peace process in Afghanistan, he expressed Pakistan resolve to find a solution to that, and termed it vital for trade activities in Afghanistan.

This led to a chief justice of the country raising an issue which should have been done by the prime minister and government. I want to thank Justice Saqib Nisar for this,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd like to speak about Faisal Vawda for a minute, because he delivered such a fiery speech. He completely forgot to speak about the dam, he just spoke about it for a couple of minutes and then moved onto other subjects,\" the premier said, as the camera zoomed in on an uncomfortable-looking Vawda. \"But he spoke from the heart,\" he added.\n\nWhile addressing the ceremony former chief justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar proposed that the monthly costs incurred on constructing the dam along with ancillary expenditure details should be made available to the public.\n\nRecounting his trips abroad to raise funds for the dam, Nisar lauded the Pakistani diaspora for being invested in the country's water crisis. 'Their wholeheartedness in addressing the country's water woes is commendable,' said Nisar. The support of the nation proved invaluable to the cause, he claimed.\n\nThe former apex court judge added that that the dam project was a responsibility the Supreme Court undertook and he fulfilled. 'I hope to see this to its completion,' he maintained.\n\n\"The Supreme Court hasn't done a favour to any one [since it initiated the dam fund]. It [the dam] has become a campaign and a movement,\" he said.\n\n\"I am hopeful, because of the manner in which you worked and the will and resolve with which the Chairman WAPDA worked, that the dam will be completed within the stipulated time and budget,\" he asserted. He also thanked immigrants for contributing to the fund.\n\nEarlier, Federal Minister for Water Resources Mohammad Faisal Vawda addressed the ceremony, while thanking the premier for instilling confidence in him and his team, and criticised previous politicians by stating that schools, hospitals, jobs and dams were not built and created as they were busy in playing politics.\n\nHe also expressed his gratitude to the army chief and the Water and Power Development Authority chairman for their contribution in the project.\n\nHe outlined that the real threat to the state is from within, and not from powers outside.
