The $1325 level above offer significant resistance. A trade through $1331.00 will signal a resumption of the uptrend. This will make $1312.70 a new main bottom.

U.S gold futures settled unchanged at $1,319.20 an ounce.\n\nGold last week rose to its highest since late April at $1,326.30, after the U.S central bank kept interest rates steady and said it would be patient on further hikes amid a cloudy outlook for the economy due to global growth concerns and the U.S-China trade dispute.\n\nGold can often take cues from moves in the dollar, with a stronger currency making commodities priced in the unit more expensive to users of other currencies.\n\nA key driver to the gold sector is its need to stay relevant to investors from both active funds and the increasingly important passive funds. Gold tends to fall out of favor when interest rates rise.\n\nThere are still political concerns which remain and that probably adds to support for gold, along with the dovish U.S Federal Reserve. Solid U.S jobs data has allayed concerns of an immediate slowdown in the U.S. economy.\n\nHigher bond yields can also pressure gold and other commodities that offer no yield but in yesterday dealings, the 10-year Treasury note yield was down 2.2 basis points at 2.701%.", "subject_codes": ",m1421,m142,npress,m14,mcat,mpcsmt,ncat,nfact,nfce,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASBUSN", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1549539666000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585463057160, "region_codes": ",usa,pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,namz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1549411200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
