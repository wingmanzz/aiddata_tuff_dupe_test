We expect that other road infrastructure projects under the CPEC will also be fast tracked in order to fully reap the benefits of the Corridor at the earliest. Along with this, there is also need to expedite the work towards the expansion and upgradation of Railways infrastructure under the CPEC to integrate the region both with rail and road infrastructure in order to give the much needed stimulus and spur to the overall economic development.\n\nThe enemy of the corridor project will not be happy over the development of the CPEC and we must remain ready to foil its nefarious designs. Any sort of propaganda against the project must be countered collectively by both Pakistan and China by staying engaged and exploring ways to expand the CPEC to other areas of mutual interests. Chinese Deputy Chief Mission Lijian Zhao really deserves applause for not only effectively highlighting the various projects being executed under the CPEC but always coming forward in a big way in countering the propaganda against it and that too with statistics to clear any confusion.", "subject_codes": ",gtrans,gcat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPKOB", "industry_codes": ",i5020041,i502,iconst,icre,", "modification_datetime": 1564742236000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585462211711, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1564704000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",oblrve,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
