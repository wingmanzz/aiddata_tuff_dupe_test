The chairman said Pakistan has friendly relations with China and there is an impression that it is an attempt to ruin these relations.\n\nChinese fake marriage, trafficking racket emerges in K-P\n\n'However, to improve these relations, oppression of girls cannot be justified,' he said. The committee later asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to brief it on this matter.\n\nThe Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF) secretary also briefed the panel on case of Abdur Rehman, a Pakistani man incarcerated in Malaysia. He said a report from the Malaysian Embassy said Rehman was involved in murder of his wife.\n\nA Malaysian high court convicted him and the verdict was upheld during appeal. There are only two ways to get a relief - a royal pardon or a relief from Malaysian federal court, the secretary said.\n\n'In this regard we are waiting for response from Abdur Rehman's family regarding the relief option that they want to adopt for,' he added. Rehman's father requested the panel to get relief for his son.\\\n\nChina withholds visas for 90 Pakistani brides over trafficking fears\n\nHe said for two years they did not know why their son was imprisoned. The chairman assured him of all possible support but said: 'If you want royal pardon then the foreign ministry is prepared but if you file a review petition then option for pardon will be eliminated. You have to take a decision.'\n\nThe OPF DG told the committee that the ministry has started one window operation for overseas Pakistanis.
