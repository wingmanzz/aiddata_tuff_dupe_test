Many\u00a0such go-between were\u00a0priests, who would help identify victims and arrange marriages.\n\nOther local agents were men and women from both the Christian and Muslim community who would help Chinese people rent houses, visit churches and arrange passports and visas for their intended victims.\n\nChinese gangs had hired these agents on lucrative salaries, Mayo said.\u00a0\n\n\"They know about the trafficking and were partners in crime. In some cases, the agents put pressure on the families of the girls to keep quiet,\" he said.\u00a0\n\n\"Their networks are very closely knitted together and work with each other,\" Mayo added.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Islamabad didn't answer questions about the arrests, although it\u00a0had warned Pakistani citizens in an earlier statement against\u00a0becoming\u00a0prey to organized trafficking gangs.\n\nThe positive projection of China and its people in Pakistani media meant that victims were more susceptible to being tricked, rights activists Taimur Kamal said.\n\n\"When people have a positive image of a nation in their mind, they tend to trust its citizens without any fear. That's might have led families becoming willing victims in these cases,\" said Kamal.\n\n# Notebook\n\n## Note to editors - Adding details of operation, background, activist quotes", "subject_codes": ",gcrim,ghutrk,gorgnz,gtraff,gcat,gcom,ghum,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "DPAEN", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1557413645000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585474426089, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1557413612020, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",pkfdvg,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
