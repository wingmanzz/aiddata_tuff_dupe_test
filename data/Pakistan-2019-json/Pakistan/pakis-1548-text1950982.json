The payment was made following an agreement with the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development in Abu Dhabi on January 22.\n\nAfter the deposits from the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the State Bank's reserves have climbed to $8.86 billion while the country's foreign exchange reserves now stand at around $15.25 billion.\n\nPakistan will be paying 3% interest rate on the payments from Saudi Arabia, and 3.18% on the UAE loans.\n\nThe country has avoided a balance-of-payment crisis this year and is close to concluding an investment agreement with China, Finance Minister Asad Umar said on Thursday. The Chinese aid, along with the support from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, is expected to help Pakistan bridge a $12 billion financing gap and negotiate better terms for a bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nSource: Geo News TV website, Karachi, in English 25 Jan 19", "subject_codes": ",gdip,gpol,gcat,gpir,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "BBCSAP", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1548406781000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585479212658, "region_codes": ",pakis,saarab,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,gulfstz,indsubz,meastz,sasiaz,wasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1548406552000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",sbpak,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
