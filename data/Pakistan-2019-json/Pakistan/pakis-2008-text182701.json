'This is very low when compared to regional economies like Vietnam with 6.3pc of GDP, Malaysia 3.02pc, Maldives 2.5pc, Sri Lanka 1.5pc, India 1.94pc, Bangladesh 1.05pc, Turkey 1.5pc, Turkmenistan 6pc, Philippines 3.2pc, South Korea 1.4pc, Cambodia 12pc etc.'\n\nHe underscored that there should be an increase in the FDI from China and other countries in the backdrop of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is a mega project committed to bringing investment from China and increasing the connectivity of Pakistan with Middle Eastern, European and Central Asian countries.\n\nThe FPCCI president urged the prime minister to promote investment culture. He also asked the government to disseminate the investment opportunities in Pakistan at the national and international levels so that the business-friendly investment policy in Pakistan, which offers many incentives to investors, could be highlighted.\n\n'At present, the law and order and energy situation in Pakistan has improved, which indicates a favourable environment for investment in Pakistan,' he stated, urging the Board of Investment to take remedial measures in order to restore the confidence of investors and project the soft image of Pakistan.\n\nAchakzai requested the government to ensure coordination among the federal and provincial investment boards so that the investment projects could be marketed in an efficient way.\n\nHe also urged the Pakistani mission abroad to highlight the investment opportunities and disseminate the information related to investment projects to the concerned investment agencies of their posted countries. 'They may be given specific targets of foreign investment according to the market size of their country of posting.'", "subject_codes": ",efdi,e51,e511,ecat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPTOD", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1559295472000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585467883157, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1559174400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",fpkch,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
