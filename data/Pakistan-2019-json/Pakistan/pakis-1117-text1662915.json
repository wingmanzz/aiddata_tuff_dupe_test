Water Resources Minister Faisal Vawda was conspicuous by his absence, though he was in the city.\n\nThe contract covers design, supply and installation of six Francis turbines, generators, main transformers and generator and station service switchgear, along with related equipment.\n\nThe Wapda chairman said signing of the contract was an important milestone for the Rs510bn hydropower project. The project, he added, was of vital importance to add a major quantum of hydel electricity to the national grid, minimise reliance on expensive thermal generation and help lower power tariff.\n\nThe water resources secretary said the ministry was committed to optimal utilisation of hydropower resources for generating low cost and environment-friendly electricity to meet the countrys energy requirements for economic stability and social development. The Dasu hydropower project, he added, was a manifestation of this commitment.\n\nHe praised Gen Hussain and his team for transforming Wapda into a proactive and dynamic organisation, adding that Wapda had been steadfastly moving to harness water and hydropower resources in the country.\n\nThe 4,320MW hydropower project is being constructed by Wapda on the Indus upstream of Dasu town in Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The project will be completed in two stages each stage having a generation capacity of 2,160MW. At present, the projects stage-I is under way, while electricity generation from the project is expected to commence in 2024-25. The stage-I will contribute more than 12 billion units per annum to the national grid. The projects stage-II will provide 9bn additional units to the system every year.\n\nThe World Bank is providing funds for the construction of the projects stage-I to the tune of $588.4 million and partial credit guarantee of $460m. The remaining funds are being arranged by Wapda from its own resources and with sovereign guarantee of the Pakistan government.\n\nThe Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources had last week expressed concern over the slow progress in acquisition of land for the Dasu hydropower project and sought an explanation from the KP government. The committee was informed that only 7.5 per cent of the total 9,875 acres of land had so far been acquired and the cost of land acquisition increased by around 95pc from Rs19bn to Rs37bn.\n\nThe project will have 12 units of 360MW each. In the first phase, 2,160MW electricity will be generated by 2023. The projects first phase started in June 2017. The second phase will begin in 2023 on the completion of the first phase.", "subject_codes": ",c332,gdip,c33,c184,c18,cactio,ccat,gcat,gpir,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "AWRTIM", "industry_codes": ",irenewee,i1610107,i1,i16,i16101,i163,i32,ieutil,iindstrls,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1574779713000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585469301450, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1574726400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",wapda,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
