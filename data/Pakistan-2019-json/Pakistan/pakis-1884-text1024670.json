It previously said four such ships had been ordered.\n\nOnce constructed, the warship will be one of the largest and technologically advanced platforms of Pakistan's Navy and strengthen the country's capability to respond to future challenges, maintain peace and stability and the balance of power in the Indian Ocean region. It will also support the Pakistani Navy's initiative of securing sea lanes for international shipping by patrolling distant waters, it said in a statement on its twitter account.\n\nType 054A is the best frigate in service with the PLA Navy. Military sources said the ship has a fully loaded displacement of about 4,000 metric tons and is equipped with advanced radars and missiles. About 30 Type 054As are in service with the PLA Navy, observers said.\n\nCao Weidong, a senior researcher at the PLA's Naval Military Studies Research Institute, said that in the past, the Pakistani Navy would ask its Chinese contractors to use Western radars or weapons on ships constructed by Chinese shipbuilders because it believed Western naval technologies were better than Chinese ones.\n\n\"But it seems that all weapons and radars on the new ship will be Chinese products, which reflects our progress in the industry and the Pakistani Navy's confidence in our technology and capability,\" he said.\n\nCao said there are many nations selling frigates in the market, so Pakistan must have made thorough comparisons in terms of combat capability and costs.\n\n\"I believe the reason they chose our type is that ours is one of the few that can carry out all of the air-defense, anti-ship and anti-submarine tasks,\" he said, expecting the service of the Chinese frigate to substantially boost Pakistan's defense capability.\n\nAn insider in China's shipbuilding sector with knowledge of the Type 054AP program told China Daily on condition of anonymity that the ship is the largest and most powerful combat vessel China has ever exported.\n\n\"Based on pictures circulating on the internet, the ship will have vertical launch cells that can fire Chinese HQ-16 air-defense missiles and other kinds of missiles. Vertical launch cells will bring flexibility to the user in terms of weapons portfolio, thus giving it a stronger fighting capability,\" he said, adding that the Type 054AP is the best frigate Pakistan can access in the international market.\n\n\"The service of Type 054APs will double the combat power of the Pakistani Navy's surface fleet,\" he said.\n\nzhaolei@chinadaily.com.cn", "subject_codes": ",gweap,gnavy,gcat,gcns,gdef,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "CHNDHK", "industry_codes": ",i36101,iindstrls,i36104,iaer,idef,", "modification_datetime": 1600763646000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1600849288670, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1546387200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",chnsc,", "action": "rep", "dateline": null}
