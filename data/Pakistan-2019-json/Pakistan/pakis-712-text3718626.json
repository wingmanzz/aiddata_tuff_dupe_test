The demand of the fishermen to construct three bridges of 100 feet width was also accepted.\n\nThe process of land acquisition has been completed. After meeting the demand of the fishermen the cost of the project will be increased by approximately Rs 1.5 billion, official source told The Nation. The source said that it has also been decided to get interest free loan from China for the project. The meeting was informed that new PC-I of the project will be submitted for the CDWP approval soon, said the source.\n\nThe Construction of Eastbay Expressway is the main artery of Gwadar Port through which the entire traffic of port will flow. The estimated cost of the project is $168 million and its objective is providing primary connectivity of the Port and its Free Zone with the network of national highways.\n\nCurrently, Gwadar Deep-Sea Port is connected through a narrow 16 feet wide thoroughfare of Gwadar town at the West-Bay. All the trawlers/trucks loaded with imported shipments pass through this strip causing disruption of normal traffic.\n\nThe port has not a dedicated wide highway to cater the transporting requirements of the post. The port operationalization, even with the available 3 multi-purpose berths, necessitates construction of the planned East-Bay expressway.\n\nThis 6-lane expressway along with a provision of 30 meters wide railway corridor shall connect the port with the Mekran Coastal Highway (N-20) through the 2300 acres Free Trade Zone of Gwadar Port.\n\nRegarding coal power plant, the meeting was informed that delay in tariff determination by NEPRA for 300 MW coal based power plant at Gwadar is the main hurdle in starting the work on the project, official source said.\n\nThe meeting discussed the progress on the Gwadar coal based power plant and it was informed that NEPRA is likely to issue tariff determination for the project by the end of current month.
