Sources said the Chinese contractors complained about the non-resolution of issues that were affecting operationalisation of the project.\n\nThe Chinese contractors highlighted the problems due to which the completion of Orange Line Metro Project Lahore was delayed. The outstanding issues include the remaining civil work on the project, municipal interface, provision of operation and maintenance team and security arrangements.\n\nThe head of Chinese delegation pointed out that any further delay in operations could cause problems.\n\nThe status of all ongoing CPEC projects would be discussed during the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting that would be held from November 5-6 in Islamabad.\n\nThe JCC is the highest decision-making body of the CPEC that takes decisions about including and excluding any project from the CPEC framework.\n\nAlthough the JCC had decided in 2017 to bring the provincial mass transit projects in the CPEC fold, the limited financing and human resources would make it difficult to simultaneously start work on all provincial projects.\n\nDue to these constraints, 'both sides agreed to move forward the three mass transit projects based on the principles of mature one, advance one,' according to the official documents.\n\nThis means the work on any new mass transit project would only begin after the completion of the ongoing scheme - the Orange Line.\n\nSources said that the next project which was considerably mature for CPEC financing was the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR).\n\nThe relevant Pakistani forums have already cleared the KCR at an estimated cost of $1.97 billion.\n\nThe representative of the Sindh government had briefed about the latest progress of KCR in the JWG meeting.\n\nThe Chinese side informed that they had not received any formal financing request from Pakistan which was required to approve loan for the project.\n\nThe federal government directed the provincial government to submit the financing request to the Centre for onwards submission to the Chinese authorities.\n\nPakistan desired to complete the KCR by September 2020 but it could not fulfill the procedural requirements and the financing for the project was also not secured.\n\nLike the much-delayed Peshawar Metro Bus project, the provincial government has also not been able to make headway on the Peshawar Mass Transit project of the CPEC.\n\nDespite the lapse of two years, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government has not been able to secure the requisite approvals from the competent authorities.\n\nThe JWG directed KP government to get the mass transit project approved from the competent forum after which it would be taken up in the next meeting which is expected to meet next year.\n\nThe representative of the KP government briefed the JWG about the main features and current status of the project. It was apprised that the project would be taken up in two phases.\n\nIt was informed that a memorandum of understanding for feasibility study had been reached between the transport department of the government of KP and China Railway Construction Corporation.", "subject_codes": ",gcat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASETRI", "industry_codes": ",i721,irailtr,itsp,", "modification_datetime": 1572350248000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585472442122, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1572307200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
