Honourable Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Judge, Supreme Court of Pakistan, was the Chief Guest and Keynote Speaker.\n\nGiven Pakistan's increased interaction with China over the past years, the CCLS has been founded as a hub for shared legal resources and an exchange of knowledge between Pakistani academics and their Chinese counterparts. The Centre with the School of Law at Wuhan University (SLWU) will also train qualified academic staff based in Pakistan in order to create capacity for the study and teaching of Chinese Law in all relevant areas of concern for Pakistan, including the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\n\nThe CCLS will broaden the legal knowledge base and equip lawyers to work on Pak-China projects. Mutual collaboration on research projects and exchange visits will build intellectual capital for both nations. In this regard, CCLS and the School of Law at Wuhan University have commenced a short Law course at SAHSOL titled, 'Introduction to Chinese Law'.\n\nIn his welcoming remarks, Dr Arshad Ahmad, Vice Chancellor LUMS, noted the importance of this partnership, \"The role of CCLS is to promote exchanges with Wuhan University to teach Chinese law courses, conduct training seminars and attend conferences and symposia on the Chinese legal system. By building academic capacity to study and teach courses in Chinese law through CCLS, both countries stand to gain as our ties are strengthened through CPEC and the Belt and Road Initiative. This important initiative must succeed for future generations not only to benefit Asia, but to benefit the world, which is increasingly looking to China for its remarkable progress in scientific research and higher education.\"\n\nDr Parvez Hassan, member of the Board of Trustees, LUMS, spoke to the audience and noted how the University is suited to spearhead this initiative. He said, \"With the growing Chinese interest in the region, SAHSOL can position itself as a leading legal research hub for students and professors, particularly from Pakistan, China and other Central Asian republics.\"\n\nSAHSOL has collaborated closely with Wuhan University to establish this Centre. As one of the earliest universities in China, it is a comprehensive research university that has been extensively involved in creating linkages with international universities across the world through exchange programmes and partnerships. Its world-class facilities and educational quality, along with its beautiful campus, attracts more than, 2000 international students every year to study in the university's various disciplines.", "subject_codes": ",guni,gcat,gedu,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "AIWBUR", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1570922400000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585471463479, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1570924800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",wuhanu,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
