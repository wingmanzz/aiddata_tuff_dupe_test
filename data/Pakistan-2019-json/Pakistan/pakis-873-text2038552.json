Addressing a ceremony held for the inauguration of International Steels Limited's new plant, he said that the committee tasked with revival of PSM has drafted its recommendations and the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) will make a decision by March.\n\nTalking about the demand, he said Pakistan's per capita usage of steel is just 42 kilogramme, far less than global per capita of 228 kg, but steel production is increasing rapidly in the country. He said that steel production has a direct relation with GDP growth of the country.
