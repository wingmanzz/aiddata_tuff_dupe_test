The first of these - the Kohala hydropower project - will come online in 2020. Kohala is due to be transferred to Pakistan after 30 years of operation 'The economic boost from additional power capacity is a clear benefit,' the bank's official said. 'For the power sector, there is also the question of how problems with distribution and utilisation can be addressed, even as capacity is increased.'\n\nThe bank said concerns have been raised about the nature of Chinese investment and the debt loads incurred in concessional loans to finance construction.\n\n'But a shift in the nature of Chinese involvement in such projects suggests the partnership is focused on long-term success.'\n\nStandard Chartered Senior Economist Bilal Khan said there is an issue of servicing the return requirements of Chinese asset owners when the projects are up and running.\n\n'In the first 10 years, it will be about servicing debt; beyond that guaranteed return-on-equity [contracts] means operators will also be sending dividends and profits back to China,' Khan says. 'Pakistan will have to make foreign exchange available for that, at the rate of between $1 billion-2.5 billion per year, depending on how much capacity comes online.'\n\nThe bank said trade routes and developing Gwadar Port are focus points of CPEC, 'thanks to Pakistan's geographic position at the epicentre of trade corridors from Western China to the Middle East, Africa and Europe, which in theory could make it the nexus of some $2.5 trillion of trade flows. 'But it also encompasses a range of infrastructure investments to bolster the business environment, including power generation.'\n\nChinese investment is not confined to power projects, but it also expanded to road and infrastructure development, boosting steel and cement manufacturing industries.\n\nPakistan was the world's fastest-growing steel producer in 2017, with crude steel output up nearly 40 per cent from 2016. Cement production has also been rising steadily and was up 14.7 per cent year-on-year by end-March 2018.\n\n'Our clients in the steel and cement industries are contemplating expansion because they see the opportunity for growth,' Nayeem added.", "subject_codes": ",e11,e1101,ecat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "NINTPK", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1562938356000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585479635872, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1562889600000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
