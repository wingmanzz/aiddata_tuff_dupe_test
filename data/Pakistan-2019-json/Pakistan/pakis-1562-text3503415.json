He added that he would ask Asad Umar to stay in the federal cabinet. Pakistan and China have agreed to amend a framework agreement on implementation of ML-I project in a bid to reduce the size of the much delayed strategically important scheme and to complete it in three phases. The decision to split the project, which was once planned to be completed in three years, suggests that work on the single largest project of CPEC will now take at least six years to complete - from the day of its ground-breaking. It has been agreed to reduce the length of the project from 1,872km to around 1,680km according to the government sources. The government has also decided to exclude the component of building a new 163km long double line between Karachi and Hyderabad from the scope of the framework agreement. It has been decided that this component will be executed on Public Private Partnership or Build Operate and Transfer Basis if declared feasible after the commercial and financial feasibility study, said sources in the Ministry of Railways.", "subject_codes": ",gpol,gcat,gpir,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASMESG", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1555993469000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585474739700, "region_codes": ",pakis,karch,laho,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1555804800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
