The government expects to raise between USD 1-2bn through the issuance of Eurobond and Sukuk bonds in order to repay the USD 1bn Sukuk loan taken in 2014 which will mature by the end of Nov. In total, ten bidders submitted offers, including JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Citibank and the Bank of China.\n\nIt is crucial for Pakistan to raise funds to ensure that its foreign exchange reserves remain stable ahead of the loan repayment, which currently stands at USD 7.7bn as of Oct 4. The response that Pakistan will receive from floating the sovereign bonds in the global capital market, the first after signing loan agreement with the IMF, will unveil the global investors' confidence in the PTI-led government's structural economic reforms.", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "CEEMAR", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1571216762000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585462189181, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1571097600000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
