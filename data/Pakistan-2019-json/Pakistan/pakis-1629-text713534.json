China and Pakistan are enjoying good military cooperation, social and cultural relationship and supporting each other at international forums,' he said.\n\nDismissing the impression that China had hegemonic or political designs under the garb of CPEC, the Chinese ambassador said that it was purely an economic project and Pakistan has joined it in accordance with its own national strategy.\n\nHe pointed out that Pakistan wanted economic stability and China was ready to help it and CPEC would play a vital role in it. He said that CPEC was initiated in 2013 but the new government in Pakistan after the 2018 general election was more interested in investment in private sector and promotion of cooperation in social sector.\n\n'Now more attention is being focused on investment and development of the less developed provinces like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan,' he added.\n\nAbout the misgivings that China would make more benefits from the Gwadar Port and more people from China were being employed in the project, the Chinese ambassador said that Gwadar Port was started in 2002 and completed in 2004 and its management was given to a Singapore firm but the port could be made functional and commercially viable in seven long years.\n\nHe said that in 2011 the Pakistan government asked China to take over its management. He said currently Gwadar Port was a losing project, but soon it would become beneficial for both the countries as joint ventures were being launched there.\n\nAbout employment, he said that so far 70,000 people from Pakistan have been employed in the CPEC related projects while the number of Chinese employees was less than 10,000.\n\nHe said that Pakistan enthusiastically wanted the Middle East countries to make investment in Gwadar and China too would welcome it.\n\nFor regional cooperation, the Chinese ambassador said that peace and stability in Afghanistan carried immense importance.\n\nHe said that China would welcome every initiative for peace in Afghanistan.\n\n'A consensus settlement between the Afghan government and Taliban will have positive impact on the development of Afghanistan, the region and regional integration,' he said.\n\nHe urged the regional stakeholders to set aside their differences and play a positive role for peace in Afghanistan.\n\nEarlier, Prof Dr Shabbir Ahmad Khan, Director Area Study Centre welcomed the Chinese ambassador.\n\nThe ambassador also delivered a lecture at the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Peshawar and answered questions. He also visited the central library of the university where the vice-chancellor received him.\n\nLater, he was the guest at a cake-cutting ceremony at the Speaker House to herald the Chinese spring festival. It was organized by the Pakistan-China Friendship Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).
