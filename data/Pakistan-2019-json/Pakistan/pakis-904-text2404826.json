By the end of 2018, China's high-speed rail operation mileage is more than 29,000 kilometers, accounting for more than 2/3 of the global high-speed rail operation mileage, which is more than the sum of other countries.\n\nIn 2019, China plans to build 3200 km of new high-speed rail lines. 'Therefore, if Pakistan wishes to reconstruct the railways and build high-speed railways, China has enough capacity to cooperate with Pakistan,' he added.\n\nCheng said railways are important infrastructures of the country, which plays an extremely important role in promoting socio-economic development.\n\nTherefore, if Pakistan wishes to get rid of poverty and backwardness and embark on the track of rapid development, it should give priority to the development of modern railway network.\n\nHe remarked that the market-oriented road should be followed, giving the task of reconstructing the existing railways and building the high-speed railway network to foreign enterprises with financial and technical strength, and then obtaining funds through bank loans.\n\nAfter completion, foreign enterprises will gradually recover the investment, and finally, hand it over to the Pakistan government. It is very important that the railways or high-speed railways should not be the financial burden of the government, but should make tax contributions to the government in the market economy, he added.\n\nIn addition, it must be noted that railway construction, especially high-speed railway construction, costs a lot. Therefore, in order to attract the investment of foreign commercial banks and construction enterprises, the Pakistani government should have preferential policies.\n\nBefore independence in 1947, Pakistan's railway network had already taken shape. Pakistan is a long and narrow country. There are three main lines from south to north, Karachi to Peshawar, Karachi to Lahore and Lahore to Peshawar.\n\nPakistan has one railway connection with India, Iran, and Afghanistan respectively, he added.", "subject_codes": ",gcat,gtrans,c24,gpol,ccat,gpir,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "NBBALU", "industry_codes": ",i5020028,i502,iconst,icre,", "modification_datetime": 1571793691000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585477308215, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1571616000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
