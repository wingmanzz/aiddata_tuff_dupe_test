The project is scheduled to be completed in five years i.e. 2024 with an estimated cost of Rs 293billion.\n\nIt will alleviate poverty by providing job opportunities to thousands of people besides locals in the project area and its annual benefits are estimated about Rs51.6 billion for the country.\n\nIts construction will help national power policy achieve the dual goals of meeting Pakistan's energy needs in a sustainable manner and ensuring generation of affordable electricity, while helping to reduce existing energy's demand and supply gap.\n\nConstruction of 213 meters high Mohmand Dam will alleviate risk of flood damages to great extend in future. The water reservoir will also control river flow and minimize intensity of floods downstream, therefore, the reservoir will be a great source of flood's protection and save fertile land from erosion.\n\nEfforts are being made to launch work on Diamer Bhasha dam by end of this year.\n\nDiamer Bhasha Dam is also a multi-purpose project aiming at water storage, flood mitigation and power generation. The project will be constructed across River Indus about 40-kilometer downstream of Chillas City.\n\nA total 272-meter high Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) Dam would have a gross water storage capacity of 8.1 million acre feet (MAF) and will generate 4500 MW of electricity with annual energy generation of more than 18 billion units of low-cost.\n\nWith the construction of Diamer Basha Dam Project, the life of Tarbela Dam will be enhanced for another 35 years.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that Pakistan receives around 142MAF water annually through western rivers of which 104MAF used for irrigation purposes.", "subject_codes": ",gnrsca,gflood,gdroug,gcat,gdis,genv,gntdis,grisk,gwea,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPKOB", "industry_codes": ",i17,i5020011,i502,iconst,icre,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1566295831000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585467169524, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1566259200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
