That said, the government's latest decision to remove the vehicle purchasing restrictions on non-income tax-filers will provide some support and stem some of the pressures coming from the slowdown in investment inflows. We have therefore moved to revise down our forecast for new vehicle sales in FY2018/19 and FY2019/20 to a 2.4% contraction and 1.3% growth respectively, down from 7.3% and 10.6% growth forecasted previously.\n\n Pakistan's Vehicle Sales To Bear The Brunt Of The Sector's Weakening\n Pakistan - New Vehicle Sales, Units y-o-y %\n\n\n\n\n\nFitch Solutions/PAMA\n\nForeign investment into Pakistan, of which around 30% comes from China, has decreased by 74.8%y-o-y over the first seven months of FY2019 (July 2018 to January 2019). Chinese investment in Pakistan, primarily as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, has slowed by 28.4% y-o-y. We believe that this slowdown in investment inflows into Pakistan will have a detrimental impact on the country's commercial vehicles segment, especially its heavy commercial vehicle segment. We forecast total commercial vehicle sales to grow by only 4.9% in FY2019. We forecast light commercial vehicle sales to remain relatively unscathed and expand by 11.8% while we forecast heavy commercial vehicle sales, which will bear the brunt of the investment slowdown, to contract by 18.1% over the same period. However, we highlight that some of this deteriorating sales outlook stems from a market correction as sales experienced a spike in FY2017/18.\n\n HCVs To Bear The Brunt Of Slowing Chinese Investment\n Pakistan - Heavy Commercial Vehicle Sales & Foreign Investment Inflows (USDmn)\n\n\n\n\n\n<TD>State Bank Of Pakistan, PAMA, Fitch Solutions\n\nWe believe that the governments' decision to remove the vehicle purchasing restrictions of non-income tax-filing consumers will prop up passenger vehicle sales as the slowdown in investment exerts a drag on consumers' willingness to make larger purchases, such as new cars. Previously non-filers of income tax where prohibited from purchasing new vehicles, which pushed the poorer consumer base out of the market, thereby somewhat limiting growth in Pakistan's new passenger vehicles sales. That said, this change in government policy will only offer marginal support to the demand for passenger vehicle sales as the majority of the non-income tax paying consumers remain poor and unable to afford new vehicles. We therefore forecast new passenger vehicle sales to contract by 3.6% in FY2019, and remain stable in FY2020, growing only 0.6%.", "subject_codes": ",e511,eitax,nanl,nimage,e21,e211,e2111,e51,ecat,ncat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "BMIAA", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1554836980000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585469160618, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1552003200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
