The delegation will interact with the local business community. It is expected that some other private level agreements will also be inked during the visit,\" Sharif said.\n\nElaborating on an oil refinery that Saudi Arabia proposes to set up in Gwadar, Sharif said it will be established at a cost of $8 billion. \"Besides foreign investment, it will also provide job opportunities to the locals of the port city. If they [Saudis] also establish a petrochemical complex along with the refinery, it will require an additional investment of billions of dollars,\" he added.\n\nHe said the Saudi government was keen to install an oil refinery at Gwadar and urged the preparation of a feasibility report in this regard.\n\nResponding to a query regarding China's reaction over Saudis investment in Gwadar, Sharif said Beijing had no objection over Islamabad's plan to establish an oil refinery at the port, which is part of the multi-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\n\n\"In fact the area where Saudis will install the refinery will exactly be determined after a feasibility study. However, it will be far away from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),\" he claimed.
