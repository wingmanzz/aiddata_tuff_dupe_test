They referenced a Bloomberg report and argued that Chinese companies work best when they carry out joint ventures.\n\nHowever, committee member and former Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) federal minister Khawaja Asif categorically rejected this claim and said that while the officials have read the Bloomberg report, they should now also study how China achieved economic growth.\n\nHe added that 90 per cent of Chinese companies are working alone on projects.\n\nNHA chairman told the sub-panel that the joint venture for CPEC projects was not an obligation, rather it was just an option.\n\nHe added that the project's cost was Rs192 billion, but they had negotiated with the Chinese company and have managed to lower the cost to Rs133 billion.\n\nThe NHA chairman further said that a loan for building the project had been provided by the Exim Bank of China. He added that it was the bank's policy to invest only in those projects where Chinese companies had been awarded the contract.", "subject_codes": ",c33,c332,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASETRI", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1552478460000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585463861969, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1552435200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
