The ship is under construction at its Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai, noting it will be equipped with modern detection and weapon systems and will be capable of anti-ship, anti-submarine, and air-defense operations.\n\nAccording to the Pakistani Navy, the ship's class is Type 054AP, which means it is based on the Type 054A of the People's Liberation Army Navy.\n\nThe ship Type 054A is the best frigate in service with the PLA Navy and has a fully loaded displacement of about 4,000 metric tons and is equipped with advanced radars and missiles. About 30 Type 054As are in service with the PLA Navy, observers said.", "subject_codes": ",gweap,gnavy,gdef,gcat,gcns,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "NBFSTA", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1546500442000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585480687137, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1546473600000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
