'The alarms bells are not ringing anymore as the government had arranged the external financing.'\n\n'We are continuously holding talks with IMF and next round will be held tomorrow through video link. We will take the loan package when it will be in the interest of people of the country. However, differences on loan programme between government and IMF is narrowing down,' he said.\n\nThe minister said that government would receive financing from China in next few days as the agreement in that respect has almost been finalised.\n\nPM's adviser Abdul Razzak Dawood announced that a delegation will visit China in a week's time.\n\nAsad Umar clarified that Pakistan had taken loans from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and China at lower interest rate. 'A perception is built that the government failed in talks [every time] before we even conclude our visit,' he complained.\n\nOn the mini-budget, Asad Umar said that a roadmap has been adopted by the government to improve the country's economy which would help in attracting investment, assisting agriculture and promoting industry.\n\nHe clarified that no new tax has been levied in the mini-budget with the exception of different rates for luxury cars. More changes will be coming in the few weeks, but a lot of the measures the government is taking are medium-term measures that won't yield results right away.\n\n'The world is progressing and leaving us behind in the sectors of education, health and economy,' he said and added that 'there are very few countries worse off than us'.\n\nThe finance minister said that incumbent government is working to control the trade deficit of the country by increasing the domestic capacity. 'If we increase our domestic capacity, we won't need to import [things]', he explained.\n\nThe current mini-budget is all about domestic supply expansion, he said. It would neither increase the revenue in five months nor will it make a big difference right now but these changes will help in the long term, he said.\n\nThere are three major issues we haven't been able to resolve, Umar said. First is that our expenses are greater than our revenue, second is that our exports are lower than our imports (and the difference is increasing) and third is low investment rates.\n\nHe added that country needs around 25 to 30 percent investment but presently has only 14 to 16 percent. Long-term progress is not possible without investment, he held.\n\nThe minister said economy will see enduring stability on completion of the tenure of PTI government due to effective measures taken by them. 'Changes never seen before will be seen in this parliament's tenure. In three-week time the stock exchange has hit 3,000 indexes,' he pointed out.\n\nEarlier, at the start of press briefing, Umar said the government was inherited a difficult economic situation when it came to power with outstanding budget deficit of $19 billion.\n\nHe said immediate steps were taken to ameliorate the financial situation and due to successful visits of Prime Minister Imran Khan to the friendly countries, it is satisfactory to note that financing gap has been bridged for 2019. He said we are thankful to friendly countries for reposing trust in our leadership.\n\nAsad said that revenues won't shrink down due to the government's measures. The government would bridge the revenue shortfall of Rs158 billion that occurred during first six months of the ongoing fiscal year. He said that federal cabinet has approved a bill related to GIDC, which would help in increasing revenues of the country after getting approval from the parliament.", "subject_codes": ",e212,gvexe,gpol,e11,e21,ecat,gcat,gpir,gvbod,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "AIWNAT", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1548410370000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585477399101, "region_codes": ",pakis,chinaz,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1548374400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",imonf,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
