Gwadar port will give the kingdom another option.\n\nIn September last year, Pakistan had formally invited Saudi Arabia to join the CPEC as a \"third strategic partner\", however a reported disagreement with China over the inclusion of a third partner in the mega project could not materialize the offer.\n\nNevertheless Riyadh has agreed to invest in CPEC-related projects. It has already announced the financing of three CPEC projects in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe mega project signed in 2014 aims to connect China`s strategically important northwestern Xinxiang province to the port of Gwadar through a network of roads, railways and pipelines in order to transport cargo, oil and gas.\n\nThe economic corridor will not only provide China with cheaper access to Africa and the Middle East, but will also earn Pakistan billions of dollars for providing transit facilities to the worlds second largest economy.", "subject_codes": ",c181,c18,cactio,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "COMSMEA", "industry_codes": ",i14001,i1,i14,iindstrls,", "modification_datetime": 1547195698000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585466961568, "region_codes": ",pakis,saarab,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,gulfstz,indsubz,meastz,sasiaz,wasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1547164800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
