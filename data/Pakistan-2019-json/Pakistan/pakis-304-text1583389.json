By the end of this year, more than 130,000 5G base stations will enter into service to support the network, marking one of the world's largest 5G deployments.\n\nThe big three telecom operators, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, for the first time chose to set tariffs by internet speed rather than data allowance. For instance, China Unicom prices the data plan, which allows peak speed of 500Mbps, at 199 yuan. For those who want to enjoy peak speed of 1Gbps, they will have to pay at least 299 yuan.\n\nThis article originally appeared on the China Economic Net", "subject_codes": ",c13,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": ",chunte,", "source_code": "ASETRI", "industry_codes": ",idct,i7902202,i3302,i3303,i7902,i79022,itech,iwrlssl,", "modification_datetime": 1572612867000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585463223398, "region_codes": ",china,chinaz,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1572566400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",lianto,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
