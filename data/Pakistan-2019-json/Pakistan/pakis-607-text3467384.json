Pakistan's exports to China are expected to reach $2.2 billion in the ongoing calendar year and $3.2 billion in the next, according to official figures.\n\n--IANS\n\nksk", "subject_codes": ",e212,e21,ecat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "HNIANS", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1553233217000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585463173388, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1553212800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",cnfina,sbpak,pkmfin,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
