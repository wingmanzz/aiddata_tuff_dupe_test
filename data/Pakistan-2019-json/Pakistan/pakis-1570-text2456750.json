Railways Chief Executive Officer Aijaz Ahmad Buriro said he was hopeful that the project would start materialising soon.\n\n'The framework of the project has already been signed and we have already sent its PC-1 to the Ministry of Planning and Development,' Buriro said told The Express Tribune.\n\n'It is an important project for us as its completion will help us manage train operations smoothly for the next 150 years,' he added.\n\n'We are still using a 150-year-old infrastructure, which is restricting us from operating at our maximum while the number of passengers has increased significantly and so have accidents.'\n\nThe Pakistan Railways is currently struggling to regain its lost momentum. It passed through its worst era between 2008 and 2013 where its revenues dropped to an alarming $18 billion.\n\nThe previous government tried hard to put the cash-strapped corporation back on track and took many initiatives which proved to be fruitful.\n\nIt managed to increase railway revenues from $18 billion to $40 billion in five years, and prepared the framework for ML-1 with Chinese authorities. Unfortunately, the project could materialise during its tenure.\n\nThe frequency of train accidents has increased during the tenure of the current government because of a low budget and the old infrastructure.\n\nAs per the feasibility report of the ML-1, the $8.2 billion project is divided in three packages and work will be executed in three provinces - Sindh, Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nThe first package, which will be executed at a cost of $2.4 billion, includes rehabilitation of the 52km Kaluwal-Pindora, the 105km Lalamusa-Rawalpindi, the 183km Nawabshah-Rohri and the 42km Peshawar-Nowshera lines. Besides, the upgrading of the Walton Railways Academy and land acquisition, supervision, escalation and security initiatives are also part of the first package.\n\nThe second package includes the revamping of the 339km Multan Lahore, the 132km Lahore-Lalamusa and the 182km Kiamari-Hyderabad tracks and the establishment of a dry port near Havelian.\n\nThe third package includes the rehabilitation of the 132km Nowshera-Rawalpindi and the 749km Hyderabad-Multan tracks. The cost of package two and three is yet to be decided.\n\nThe entire ML-1 covers a 1,872km track. It also includes the laying of a new track with improved subgrade for 160km/h speed, rehabilitation and construction of major bridges, provision of modern signalling and telecom systems, conversion of level crossings in to underpasses/flyovers and fencing the entire track to run trains on fast track.\n\n'This project will be a paradigm shift for railways and for the country's overall economy, it will increase the line capacity from 138 trains to 171 trains each day,' Buriro said, adding: 'It will also increase the freight volumes from six to 35 million tons per annum by 2025 thereby increasing railways share of freight transport volume from less than 4% to 20%.'\n\nMany Railways officials said the corporation had no other option but to opt for Chinese financing for ML-1. However, Buriro said they also had a plan B.\n\n'We have cleared all the hurdles stalling Chinese investment in the project, but in case there is a delay we can use Public Sector Development Program [PSDP] funds for revamping some crucial parts of ML-1, he added.", "subject_codes": ",gtrans,gcat,nimage,ncat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASETRI", "industry_codes": ",i71,irailtr,itsp,", "modification_datetime": 1570798266000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585483962221, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,laho,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1570752000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",pakral,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
