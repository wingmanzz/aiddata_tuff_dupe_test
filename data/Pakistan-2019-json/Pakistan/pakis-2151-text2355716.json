Md. Tanbir Rahman has been nominated as the Project Director.\n\nThe site selection process was started immediately and the acquisition proposal was submitted to the DC office, Bagerhat in August, 2017.\n\nThe site was officially handed over to NWPGCL on 28 January, 2018.\n\nThe EPC of the project, China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC), started land filling and land development work immediately.\n\nIn the meantime, the civil work of the 15km transmission line for the power evacuation to the Gopalganj grid substation was also started. After soil test and design, the first pile at the project site was installed on 10 May, 2018.\n\nSix W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 18V50 engines arrived at site on 13 June, 2018. After the completion of the transmission line and the substation work, the back energization was done on 13 February, 2019. After the commissioning of all the systems including engine commissioning, all the engines were synchronized to the national grid on 15 March, 2019.\n\nThe power plant started its reliability run on 11 April, 2019. After passing the reliability run and the Dependable Capacity Test, the plant started its commercial operation on 17 April, 2019 and the capacity was declared as 105MW. While implementing the project, the project personnel had to face several challenges which eventually affected the project completion.\n\nThe biggest challenge was the land acquisition and construction of the 15km transmission line within due time. Moreover, many of the transmission line towers were in very low and water stagnant areas. Material transportation in those locations was horribly difficult.\n\nThe project also had to face several natural disasters in both China and B a n g l a d e s h .\n\nThese disasters delayed several crucial shipments of materials which eventually affected the project progress severely. Despite of several crucial issues, the M a d h u m a t i plant is the fastest among the governmentowned generation companies to come into operation.", "subject_codes": ",c24,ccat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ENEPOW", "industry_codes": ",i5020042,i502,iconst,icre,i1,i16,i16101,ieutil,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1562305633000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585477464587, "region_codes": ",bandh,pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1559260800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",bgdpwg,bapod,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
