With the objective to improve sustainable forest ecosystem management in support of the government's Large-Scale Greening Sichuan Program, it will focus on two areas:\n\nPromoting best practices for forest ecosystem management to increase forest cover, improve forest quality and resilience, and improve the effectiveness of ecosystem management and restoration;\n\nStrengthening institutional capacity in support of sustainability by improving long-term forest management planning at provincial and county levels, promoting inclusive forest carbon trading system development as part of the national Emissions Trading System, strengthening and standardizing the forestry sector financial performance management system, and improving training and technical services.\n\nThe program will deliver global public goods by promoting sound forest management practices to enhance forestry's contribution to ecosystem restoration, biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration. It is estimated that around 23.53 million tons of net carbon dioxide equivalent will be sequestered over a 30-year period. The program will also improve ecological services in the form of hydrology, water security, and ecosystem functions provided by the Yangtze River Basin.", "subject_codes": ",gnatcn,gqual,genv,gcat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "PAPRIN", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1576857437000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585462545581, "region_codes": ",china,chinaz,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1576713600000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",twban,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
