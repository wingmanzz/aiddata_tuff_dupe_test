SEP currently provides 30,000 megawatts electricity to Shanghai, China's economic hub and has proven its technical capabilities within power sector investments in other parts of the world. SEP is also amongst the few companies, which have been issued a license to build nuclear power plants in China and its affiliate companies are already working on critical projects in Pakistan.\n\n'The government has expressed confidence in the proposed deal based on the transformational impact it is expected to have on Karachi as well as Pakistan's overall power sector,' Alvi said.\n\nSEP and KES Power concluded a transaction for SEP to acquire a 66.4pc stake in KE in October 2016 and SEP has subsequently renewed its intention to acquire it during the stipulated period under the prevalent rules. While there are several examples of successful long-term acquisition deals in the world of finance, two years is nevertheless a fairly long time and deal fatigue is a real risk.\n\n'The acquisition has taken much longer than it should have. If I were to really sum it up, I would pin it on the red tape in some areas. One of the main bottlenecks was the multi-year tariff determined by the regulator which has taken much longer than anticipated and was not in line with what had been requested to stimulate further investment in transmission and distribution. The deliberations on the security clearance have also been going on for a while,' the CEO concluded.", "subject_codes": ",c181,cactio,c18,cacqu,gira,c11,ccat,gcat,gpersf,gretir,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPTOD", "industry_codes": ",i1,i16,i16101,i1610108,ieutil,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1550145027000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585469422733, "region_codes": ",pakis,shahai,karch,apacz,asiaz,bric,china,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1550016000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",shelpw,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
