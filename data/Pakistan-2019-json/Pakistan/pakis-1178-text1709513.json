'However, trends suggest that Pakistan may continue to depreciate its currency by 2-5% per annum in months and years to come to maintain Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) of rupee at equilibrium.\n\nAnother analyst said the drop in investment was seen as China slowed down investment in Pakistan in its multibillion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) following a number of early harvest projects nearing completion.\n\n'China's investment will remain sluggish as Pakistan will mostly use local resources to set up hydel power projects under the second phase of CPEC,' he said.\n\nCountry-wise FDI\n\nDespite the slowdown, China remained the single largest foreign direct investor in Pakistan.\n\nIt invested net $405.8 million in the nine-months, which was, however, 74.4% lower than $1.6 billion invested in the same period of last year.\n\nDuring the period under review, United Kingdom remained the second largest investor with $149.8 million, 37.4% lower than $239.2 million invested in the same period last year.\n\nHong Kong invested $106.8 million compared to $145.4 million.\n\nOn the contrary, Malta divested $104.9 million compared to zero investment/divestment in the same period last year.\n\nSector-wise FDI\n\nThe oil and gas exploration sector attracted the single largest FDI (net) worth $253.2 million in nine months compared to $295.4 million in the same period last year.\n\nFinancial business received $247.6 million compared to $361.2 million, while electrical machinery attracted $126.6 million compared to just $13.8 million.
