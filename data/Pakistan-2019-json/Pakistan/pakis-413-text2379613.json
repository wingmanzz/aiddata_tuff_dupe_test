The data is constantly updated to know the real time situation of their students. On the other hand Chinese companies if require a group of skilled workforce in a specific district face inadequate circumstances. The initiative will serve to connect the skilled workforce with the job opportunities under CPEC by providing a unique demand driven database to employers.\n\nThe Chinese companies will register with the National Job Portal for CPEC and they would be required to enlist their future labour demand according to the nature of the project.\n\nSubsequently, NAVTCC will initiate technical and vocational training for the semi or unskilled local youth making them capable to meet the demand of the employers at their proposed location in the near future.", "subject_codes": ",gjob,gcat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "NBBALU", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1552048824000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585471136502, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1552003200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
