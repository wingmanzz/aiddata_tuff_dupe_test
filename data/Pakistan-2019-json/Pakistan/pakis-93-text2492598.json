Of this, $253.2m were invested in September.\n\nOn the other hand, inflows from China plunged 70.4pc to $103m during July-September versus $348m in corresponding months last year.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan recently visited China to speed up the working on projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\n\nSector-wise investment indicates that telecommunications attracted highest amount of $246.4 million during the quarter. This represented a massive growth of 389.6pc over $54m recorded in July-September FY19.\n\nInflows in the oil and gas exploration, on the flip side, dipped by 54pc to $34.1m during the first quarter, compared to $74.1m in same period last fiscal year.\n\nThe sector is at the top of government's priority list for attracting investments but the response during the latest quarter is disappointing.\n\nThe attraction for hydel power also declined as the investment fell to $27.3m, from $36m. Inflows in cars didn't show much difference as they came in at $25.8m, down from $29.5m.\n\nHowever, a big jump was noted in electrical machinery as it received $64.8m during the quarter, rising from 1QFY19 level of just $5.2m.\n\nA major change was noted in portfolio investment which had been showing outflows for most of the time but in the latest quarter posted a net inflow at $22.7m, as opposed to a net outflow of $185.3m in corresponding months last year.", "subject_codes": ",efdi,e51,e511,ecat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASDAWN", "industry_codes": ",i81502,ifinal,iinv,", "modification_datetime": 1571381007000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585478273939, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1571356800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
