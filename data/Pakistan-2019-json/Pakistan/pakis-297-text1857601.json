Following the agreement, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) increased the policy rate by 150bps. Shortly after, the Ministry of Finance of Pakistan presented a budget in June with the aim of trimming Pakistan's primary deficit to 0.6% of GDP in FY19/20, from 1.9% of GDP in FY18/19 according to the IMF's estimates. Given the tighter monetary and fiscal policies amid an already subdued economic growth outlook, we at Fitch Solutions have revised our forecast for Pakistan's real GDP growth to come in at 3.2% in FY18/19 and 2.7% in FY19/20 (from 4.4% in FY18/19 and 4.0% in FY19/20 previously), from 5.4% in FY17/18. This is slightly lower than the government's expectation of 3.3% real GDP growth in FY18/19, which is also in line with the Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nHigher Taxes Will Erode Purchasing Power\n\nWe expect consumption (around 82% of GDP) to slow in growth to 5.3% in FY19/20, down from 6.3% in FY17/18 as purchasing power will likely decline. Inflation has been on the rise in Pakistan, increasing by 9.1% y-o-y in May, compared with 4.2% y-o-y in the previous year. Moreover, as part of the deal with the IMF, Pakistan promised to reduce its primary deficit to 0.6% of GDP in FY19/20, primarily through tax-based measures including raising the tax rate on sugar from 8% to 17% and moving cigarette taxes into higher brackets ( see 'Pakistan To See Little Fiscal Consolidation Despite IMF Deal', June 18). Given our expectations for continued upside pressure on consumer prices over the coming months, we believe that the consumers' purchasing power will continue to fall over the coming months, thereby weighing on consumption. However, we note that some of the effect of price hikes will be partially offset by the government's populist measures, such as providing electricity subsidies to consumers who use less than 300 units of electricity per month.\n\n Inflationary Pressure On The Rise\n Pakistan - Inflation & SBP's Inflation Target\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: SBP, Fitch Solutions\n\nAusterity Measures On The Cards\n\nWe forecast government spending (around 12% of GDP) to slow in growth to 6.4% in FY19/20, down from 14.2% in FY17/18, as the country embarks on an austerity drive. IMF bailout packages typically require countries to undergo fiscal consolidation, which usually include austerity measures. While Pakistan and the IMF have agreed on focusing on tax-based measures to manage the fiscal deficit, according to media reports, we believe that the Pakistani government will fall short of its ambitious revenue targets and will likely have to cut spending to meet the primary deficit target of 0.6% of GDP ( see 'Pakistan To See Little Fiscal Consolidation Despite IMF Deal', June 18).\n\n US And China Are Two Of The Largest Export Destination\n Pakistan - Export Destination, % Share Of The Total\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: SBP, Fitch Solutions\n\nDeteriorating Net Exports To Further Weigh On Growth\n\nWe expect to see little improvement in Pakistan's net exports, which recorded a deficit of around 11% of GDP in FY17/18. Despite the government's efforts to increase export competitiveness, such as subsidising electricity and gas to the industrial and export sectors, a global slowdown will likely weigh on exports over the coming months. Our view is for global growth to slow from 3.2% in 2018 to 2.9% by 2020, with growth in two of the largest main export destinations, the US and China, slowing to 2.0% and 6.1% respectively by 2020, from 2.9% and 6.6% in 2018.\n\n Weakening Currency To Amplify Effect Of Oil Price Increase\n Global - Brent Crude Oil Prices, PKR & USD\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Fitch Solutions\n\nMoreover, we believe that imports could increase over the coming months acting as a slight drag on growth. Given that Pakistan's main imports are petroleum and its products (around 28% of total imports), rising oil prices will likely weigh on net exports. Our Oil and Gas team forecasts Brent Crude oil prices to average USD70/barrel (bbl) in 2019 and USD76/bbl in 2020, from a year-to-date average of USD66.15/bbl. The impact of rising oil prices on imports will be exacerbated by a weakening currency. Following the agreement with the IMF, the Pakistani rupee has been devalued by more than 10% to around PKR157/USD at the time of writing, from around PKR142/USD before the agreement took place in May.\n\n Downtrend Spiral In Sentiment\n Pakistan - Karachi Stock Exchange-100 Index\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Fitch Solutions\n\nTighter Monetary Policy To Weigh On Investment Growth\n\nWe believe that investment, which accounts for approximately 17% of GDP, will slow in growth to 5.1% in FY19/20, from 5.7% in FY17/18, as tighter monetary policy implemented by the SBP will likely weigh on investment. Since the start of the fiscal year (July 2018), the SBP has increased its policy rate by 575bps, to 12.3% in May from 6.5% in the beginning of July 2018. Moreover, the government has committed to borrow less from the SBP as part of the IMF deal, which will improve the monetary policy transmission in the country.\n\n Manufacturing Activity Has Slowed\n Pakistan - Large Scale Manufacturing Industries Quantum Index & % chg y-o-y (3mma)\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: SBP, Fitch Solutions\n\nIn addition, business sentiment will likely remain subdued in Pakistan, leading to slower investment growth. Pakistan's Karachi Stock Exchange-100 Index has already fallen by more than 14% since July 2018, reaching the lowest levels since March 2016, suggesting that investor confidence in the economy has fallen. The large-scale manufacturing (LSM) industries have also been contracting over the past few months, with the quantum index recording a 6.7% y-o-y decline in March. With a slowdown of manufacturing activity, we expect to see a fall in investment appetite related to LSM industries, such as investment in capital goods.\n\nSome Of The Key China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Projects\n Project Name                                                      Cost Of Project (USDmn)   State Date   Expected End Date\n Source: Fitch Solutions\n Dasu Hydropower Project, Phase I                                  4,200                     2017         2022\n HUBCO Coal - Fired Power Plant                                    2,000                     2017         2019\n Karot Hydropower Plant Project                                    2,000                     2015         2020\n Suki Kinari Hydropower Plant                                      1,900                     2017         2022\n Karakoram Highway, Phase II, Raikot - Islamabad Upgrade Project   1,366                     2016         2020\n SSRL Thar SEC Mine Mouth Power Plant                              1,300                     2017         2019\n\n\nCPEC To Provide Some Relief\n\nThat said, investment related to the CPEC, a centrepiece of China's Belt and Road Initiative, will likely provide some support to the economy over the coming quarters. Construction of many key CPEC projects have already started and will stretch over the coming years. In addition, there are more projects in the pipeline that are still at the planning stage but will likely commence soon. We believe that the CPEC will continue to make progress given China's continued push on project implementation and the improving bilateral relationship between the two countries. Debt concerns, which was one of the major challenges for CPEC projects, also seem to have receded for now. In December 2018, Pakistan's Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform and the Chinese embassy in Pakistan released statements to improve transparency of the financials relating to CPEC projects ( see 'CPEC To Remain A Primary Driver Of Pakistan's Construction Industry', January 25).", "subject_codes": ",c341,ecat,e1106,nanl,nimage,e11,e1101,c13,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "CFWK", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1594245683000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1594282951441, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1561507200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",imonf,sbpak,pkmfin,", "action": "rep", "dateline": null}
