He advised the students not to limit the scope of their education to a degree and expand their canvas to learning about the vast spectrum of engineering, covering logistics, infrastructure, and impact. He said transportation engineering has become a destiny of all nations, as it plays a pivotal role in development of countries.\n\nShedding light on the evolution of transportation sector over the years, he said the high-speed railway track transportation system of China has shrunk the distances and taught the world a lesson about importance of time. \"Go with an aim to learn from China as to how the Chinese manage time, work as a team, and come up with masterpieces\" he emphasised.\n\nLt.
