Priority is to be given to schemes to be executed in the lesser developed or backward areas of each province like South Punjab, newly merged areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and North Sindh.\n\nThe scope of cooperation under the socio-economic development grant will be for implementation of high-impact, short gestation and high-visibility projects covering major cooperation areas of agriculture, medical treatment, poverty alleviation, water supply, education and vocational training.\n\nThese projects will be implemented incrementally: fast-track projects will be competed in one year and mid- and long-term schemes in two and three years respectively.
