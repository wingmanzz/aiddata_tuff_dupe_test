Beijing laws require Chinese investors to take permission from the regulators for investment in other countries.\n\nMehdi said the PSX had signed a contract with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) to acquire a new trading and surveillance system at a cost of $2.85 million.\n\nThe new system would connect the PSX with three Chinese international stock markets including the SZSE, Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges. The linkage will allow cross-listing of companies and attract foreign investment in each other\u2019s stocks.\n\nEarlier, a Chinese consortium acquired a 40% stake in the PSX \u2013 the company running the stock trading platform \u2013 at Rs28 per share in January 2017.\n\nA high PSX official told on the sidelines of a conference that the bourse had written three letters to the Ministry of Finance, requesting it to initiate talks with the Chinese government for seeking approval for Chinese investment in the PSX.\n\n\u201cHowever, no progress has been made so far,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we are planning to take a delegation to meet Prime Minster Imran Khan in this regard.\u201d\n\nThe PSX chairman revealed that the new trading and surveillance system would be fully deployed over the next 12 to 14 months. \u201cHowever, an interim surveillance system will be in place by February 2020.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the apex regulator \u2013 Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) \u2013 had given the PSX a deadline to deploy a surveillance system by December 2019.\n\nThe new system will replace the existing Karachi Automated Trading System (KATS). Initially, both the trading systems will run parallel for the stockbrokers and investors.\n\n\u201cThe new trading system will completely replace the existing one after users get fully familiar with the new system,\u201d Mehdi said.\n\nPSX had shortlisted two global stock markets for buying the trading and surveillance system, including the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe offer and terms and conditions of the SZSE were found suitable for the PSX. \u201cPSX will pay the price ($2.85 million) in installments over a period of five years. Moreover, it will be a one-time cost rather than paying the system licence renewal fee every year,\u201d he said.\n\nSZSE is the third largest stock market in the world in terms of trading value. It is also part of the Chinese consortium that has acquired 40% stake in the PSX.", "subject_codes": ",m11,mcat,ncat,nfact,nfce,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASGULF", "industry_codes": ",i831,ifinal,iinv,", "modification_datetime": 1575904876000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585483543206, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1575763200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
