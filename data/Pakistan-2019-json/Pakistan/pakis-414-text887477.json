Besides, he said, there are many other projects in the pipeline.\n\nHe said CPEC has four priorities, including power plants, infrastructure development, renovation of Gwadar Port, and industrial development.\n\nZhao Lijian said foundation for industrial development was laid during the last five years by addressing infrastructure and energy issues in Pakistan.\n\nHe said in the next stage, industrial development in Pakistan is being discussed.\n\nThe ambassador said nine areas have been identified for developing Special Economic Zones across Pakistan. He said three projects, including Rashakai, Quaid-e-Azam Industrial Park, and Dhabeji Special Economic Zone have been prioritised.\n\nHe expressed confidence that groundbreaking of Rashakai Special Economic Zone would be performed soon after Prime Minister Imran Khan's ongoing visit to China.\n\nZhao Lijian said Special Economic Zones will significantly contribute to overall economic development of Pakistan by enhancing its foreign exchange reserves and exports.\n\nHe said that following the conclusion of the ongoing Belt and Road Forum, the two countries are likely to sign joint statement on Main Line-I project of doubling railway line from Karachi to Peshawar.\n\n'CPEC is a project of regional economic development and any third party participation will be welcomed in it,' he said.\n\nHe said third party participation is already involved in CPEC in form of funding of Karot Hydropower project by the World Bank Group and the engagement of Qatari companies in various projects.\n\nResponding to a question about the second phase of Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which is likely to be finalised between the two countries soon, Zhao Lijian said Pakistan is among the first countries with whom China is signing FTA.\n\nHe said the two sides have been engaged to upgrade the existing FTA, and to this effect, the eleventh and last round of talks is going to take place.\n\nThe ambassador said under the new FTA, Chinese government is offering ninety percent of market share to Pakistanis goods into Chinese market. He said China is asking for sixty-five percent of the market access to Pakistan at zero tariff rate.
