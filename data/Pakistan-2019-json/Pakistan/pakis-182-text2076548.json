Some countries are averse to this game changer project; that's why the Government of Pakistan under the able leadership of PM Imran Khan is trying its utmost for its timely completion, so that it does not face any problems.\n\nCPEC will provide thousands of jobs to the unemployed youth in the country. This project will change the fate of the country and it is the only project that Pakistan is putting more and more efforts and wants that it should be completed as soon as possible. The biggest enemy of Pakistan, India, is not happy with Pakistan and does not want that this project should be completed and Pakistan should develop.
