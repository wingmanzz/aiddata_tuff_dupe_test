It will transform southwestern Yunnan province into a trading hub that exports China's goods to Southeast Asian markets.\n\nIn Africa, a Belt and Road railway has connected Nairobi and Mombasa on the Indian Ocean coast, linking the Kenyan capital with its largest port.\n\nIn Pakistan, a controversial trade route was inaugurated to link its southwestern Gwadar port, on the Arabian Sea, with Kashgar, a city in China's northwestern Xinjiang province.\n\nThe China-Pakistan Economic Corridor includes a 392-kilometre highway from Peshawar to Karachi scheduled to be completed this year, a new highway, airport and hospital at Gwadar port, among many other projects in the country.\n\nThe port will provide China with safer and more direct access to the oil-rich Middle East than the waterway trade route it currently uses through the narrow Malacca Straits.\n\n\"Our critical infrastructure gaps are being plugged. Gwadar, once a small fishing village, is transforming rapidly into a commercial hub,\" Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan told the summit.\n\nThe economic corridor has alarmed India because it cuts through Gilgit and Baltistan in Pakistan-administered Kashmir -- disputed territory that New Delhi claims is illegally occupied.\n\nrwm/lth/dan", "subject_codes": ",gtrans,gdip,e11,ecat,gcat,gpir,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "AFPR", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1556254285000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585462948177, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,easiaz,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1556254271000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",oblrve,", "action": "add", "dateline": "Beijing, April 26, 2019 (AFP) - "}
