The fact that China has never invaded any country proves that China is a peace-loving country and it has no intentions of expanding its territory, he added.\n\nMr Chen Xiang said that Pakistan-China friendship is higher than mountains and deeper than the ocean and both countries can potentially help each other in achieving economic goals. 'Agriculture-based market in China is widely open for Pakistan as it is very difficult for China to feed 22 per cent of the world's population with only seven percent of the planet's arable land,' he maintained. Mr Chen Xiang, who has been living in Pakistan for more than a decade, threw light on the negative role of Western media which has long been spreading fabricated news to malign China. 'China takes no country as its rival including the United States however it seems that America is not happy with the rapid growth of China.'\n\nAccording to Mr Chen Xiang, CPEC has linked Pakistan's growth with China. The mega project would help curb the menace of poverty, not only from Pakistan but also from the entire region, he said, adding that Pakistan will too grow and develop with the growth of China.\n\nAddressing on the occasion, the Vice Chancellor Dr Ishtiaq Ahmad said that Pakistan should follow the footprints of China which has lifted 850 million people out of poverty and corruption.\n\nIn his view, Pakistan should further strengthen its economic ties with China as it will be the largest economy of the world in coming years. He informed the participants that Sargodha University has signed many MoUs with Chinese institutes in the field of agriculture that would help uplifting the agriculture in Sargodha region. Dr Fazalur Rahman said in his address that the Confucius Institute would soon be established at the University of Sargodha to promote Chinese language and culture while two Chinese language teachers have already joined the University to start Chinese language course.", "subject_codes": ",gfake,gcat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "AIWNAT", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1574847443000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585485585445, "region_codes": ",china,chinaz,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1574812800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",hcarni,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
