Since the beginning of the incumbent government's tenure, China has already twice provided monetary assistance to Pakistan. What's important to note is that the money has been given as a loan and that Pakistan will have to pay it back.\n\nThe short-term impact of this assistance will be nullified once the government starts with the repayments. Given the spiral of the economic crisis that the government is stuck with, the impact of these measures is likely to be shorter than expected.", "company_codes_relevance": "", "body": "", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASETRI", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1549266588000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585487463781, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,laho,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1549152000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
