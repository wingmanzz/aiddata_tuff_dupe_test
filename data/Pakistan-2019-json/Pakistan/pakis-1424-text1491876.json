On May 6, the FIA arrested eight Chinese men said to be involved in trafficking Pakistani girls to China under the guise of marriage.\n\nThe matter took an even more sinister turn when some of the victims came forward saying they were forced into prostitution. They said the women who resisted were used for illegal organ transplants.\n\nOn Friday, the government of China issued an official statement on the matter saying that if any organisation or individual commits a crime in Pakistan under the guise of cross-border marriage, Beijing will support Islamabad in cracking down on such activities in accordance with Pakistani law.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan said, 'China's position on the issue of transnational marriage is very clear, that is to protect legitimate marriages and combat crimes. If any organisation or individual commits a crime in Pakistan under the banner of the cross-border marriage, China supports the Pakistani side to crack down on it according to Pakistani laws.'\n\nFIA arrests eight Chinese men involved in human trafficking\n\n'The Ministry of Public Security of China sent a task force to Pakistan to carry out law enforcement cooperation with the Pakistani side. China will further strengthen cooperation with the law enforcement agencies in Pakistan, effectively combat crime, so as to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the two peoples, and jointly safeguard China-Pakistan friendly relations.'\n\nThe Chinese spokesperson further claimed that some media reports also fabricated facts and spread rumours and hoped 'the people of China and Pakistan do not believe the rumours'.", "subject_codes": ",ghutrk,gwedd,gcrim,gtraff,gorgnz,gcat,gcom,ghum,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASETRI", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1557568644000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585481851087, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1557446400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",pkfdvg,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
