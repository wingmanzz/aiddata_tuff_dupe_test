The PC-1 for Package-1 is based on cost estimates validated by third party review consultants.\n\nThe committee expressed serious concern over the $8.2 billion cost while observing the rupee depreciation against dollar, saying the country would pay much higher price. The committee was further informed that of the $8.2 billion, major chunk would be spent on imports where the railways would pay around 33 percent duty/taxes on import.\n\nSenator Mirza Mohammad asked whether railways minister ever raised this issue at higher level and the response from secretary was 'no'. Afridi recommended for duty/taxes exemption of railways imports. However, the committee deferred the point till next meeting for further discussion.\n\nThe upgrade project of ML-1 has been declared a strategic commercial project with loan on favourable terms as it presents a perfect business plan covering 75 percent traffic/population and 65 percent industrial areas. With the upgrade of ML-1, train speed will increase from the current 65-105 km to 120-160 km, line capacity from 34 to 171 trains each way per day, freight volumes from 6 to 35 millions tons per annum by 2025, and railway share of freight transport volume would increase from less than 4 percent to 20 percent.\n\nRailways Divisional Superintendent (DS) Karachi, Mazhar Ali Shah informed the committee that right of way has been cleared for the KCR from encroachment and only 5 km is left which would be cleared after the project initiated. However, he said the Sindh government is fully cooperating with the railways, which will expedite the project pace.\n\nThe secretary railways informed the committee that he was not sure whether the project would be initiated under the CPEC or not, as from the meetings with the Sindh government he felt that they are keen to take the KCR project with Japan. He said that the Sindh government thinks that Japan is offering loans on favourable terms compared to China.\n\nThe member finance railways informed the committee that there is a gap of Rs 20 million per day in the railways revenue and expenditure as per the data of current fiscal year. He said the railways is generating around Rs 139 million per day revenue compared to Rs 159 million per day expenditure.\n\nAfridi expressed serious reservations over the revenue and expenditure gap, saying that it means that the Railways is facing around Rs 6 billion deficit per month. However, the Railways officials said there are some months every year when the gap between revenue and expenditure goes widened but in later months it would improve. He further said that the Railways has projected to generate Rs 58 billion revenue in the current fiscal year compared to Rs 53 billion last year.\n\nThe committee also recommended for plying a fright train from Karachi to Torkham for transit trade, saying it would reduce the transportation cost while railways would earn more.\n\nThe Railways Ministry said at present it has neither space nor capacity to run any additional passenger or cargo train; however, it would work on the proposal in future.", "subject_codes": ",gtrans,gcat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "AIWBUR", "industry_codes": ",i5020028,i502,iconst,icre,", "modification_datetime": 1570576339000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585462379517, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,jap,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1570579200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",jaicag,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
