The margin is set at 295bp over Libor, said the banker, who declined to disclose further pricing details about the commitment levels on offer.\n\nThe proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.\n\nThe deadline for commitments is end of July.\n\nThis was the second borrowing from the Hong Kong-listed property firm in six months. Last December, Country Garden sealed a $930m dual-currency facility, which split into a HK$3.47bn ($444m) tranche and a $486.2m portion, according to a stock exchange filing. The tenor was three years.\n\nHSBC and ICBC Asia were the MLABs. The proceeds were for refinancing debt.\n\nUAF taps two banks\n\nfor HK$1.6bn loan\n\nUnited Asia Finance, a personal loan provider in Hong Kong, is seeking a HK$1.6bn ($205m) borrowing in syndication.\n\nMizuho and Standard Chartered are the mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners, according to a banker who received the invitation.\n\nThe deal has an average life of three years. It offers a margin of 190bp over Hibor \u2014 the same margin that UAF offered for its loan last year. But this time, the participation fees are 15bp lower.\n\nMandated lead arrangers committing HK$300m and above receive a 75bp fee for 215bp all-in, lead arrangers committing HK$200m-HK$290m receive 60bp for 210bp all-in, and arrangers committing HK$100m-HK$190m make 45bp for 205bp all-in.\n\nThe proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Lenders have until July 19 to make commitments.\n\nUAF, formerly known as Japan Finance (International), is controlled by financial services firm Sun Hung Kai & Co.\n\nIt is a frequent borrower in the loan market. UAF closed a HK$4.7bn fundraising last July, which started at an initial size of HK$1.6bn, led by Mizuho, Standard Chartered and Taipei Fubon Bank. It received a strong response during syndication, attracting 18 participants.\n\nThat loan had a door-to-door life of four years with an average life of three years. The all-ins ranged from 210bp to 220bp.\n\nShangshi seeks $190m\n\nvia Deutsche Bank\n\nShanghai Shangshi (Group), part of Chinese state-owned Shanghai Industrial Investment Holdings, is tapping the offshore loan market for $190m.\n\nDeutsche Bank is the sole mandated lead arranger and bookrunner, according to a banker who received the invitation.\n\nThe loan has a tenor of three years with bullet repayment. The margin is set at 220bp over Libor. Two ticket levels are open to lenders. Those committing $30m and more can earn a 60bp fee for 240bp all-in, and those chipping in between $15m and $29m earn a 45bp fee for 235bp all-in.\n\nA special purpose vehicle under Shangshi is the borrower, while the parent is providing a guarantee.\n\nThe loan will be used for refinancing. The deadline for commitments is July 12.\n\nThe State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission controls Shangshi, which is operated by its parent SIIC. Registered in Hong Kong, SIIC engages in pharmaceuticals, infrastructure, real estate consumer products and financial services.\n\nIn June last year, SIIC received a HK$1.5bn ($191m) club loan from Bank of Communications, DBS, Shanghai Pudong Development and United Overseas Bank, according to Dealogic.\n\nThat five year borrowing offered a margin of 130bp over Hibor.\n\nPakistan woos banks\n\nfor sovereign loan\n\nPakistan\u2019s ministry of finance has made a quick loan comeback, six months after closing its last borrowing.\n\nCredit Suisse is the sole mandated lead arranger and bookrunner, said a source close to the situation.\n\nThe lead bank advanced a $200m loan to the country in May, and is inviting more lenders to participate in the deal to increase its size.\n\nThe one year transaction offers the same margin as Pakistan\u2019s last loan, said the source. The margin for Pakistan\u2019s $245m deal sealed last December, also a one year facility, was 200bp over Libor, according to Dealogic.\n\nThe source declined to disclose the participation fees, but said it is slightly higher than last year\u2019s borrowing.\n\nThe new deal will target the sovereign\u2019s existing lenders and Chinese banks during syndication. Credit Suisse also led the country\u2019s December fundraising. China Minsheng Bank, United Bank and National Bank of Pakistan participated, according to Dealogic.\n\nIn May, Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund reached a preliminary agreement on a $6bn three year bailout, which the country\u2019s prime minister Imran Khan has been working on since he came to office last year.\n\nSeparately, Laos\u2019s ministry of finance received a $150m-equivalent five year euro denominated loan from Credit Suisse. The source said that this deal will be syndicated if the sovereign decides to boost the loan size.\n\nThe proceeds will be used to support the country\u2019s long-term investments.\n\nMalakoff returns for\n\nA$140m refinancing\n\nMalaysia\u2019s utilities and infrastructure company Malakoff Corp has launched a A$140m ($96.8m) refinancing loan into general syndication.\n\nSumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp is the sole mandated lead arranger and bookrunner for the facility, according to a source close to the deal.\n\nThe loan has a door-to-door life of three years. The average life is 2.565 years, assuming drawdown in mid-August. It offers a margin of 143bp over the bank bill swap bid rate.\n\nTwo ticket levels are up for grabs. Lead arrangers committing A$20m or more receive a 30bp fee for 154.7bp all-in, and arrangers committing A$10m-A$19m earn a 20bp fee for 150.8bp all-in.\n\nMalakoff International is the borrower while the parent company is providing a guarantee.\n\nThe proceeds will be used to refinance a A$140m three year deal raised in 2016. That facility was led by ANZ and SMBC, according to Dealogic. No pricing details were disclosed.\n\nThe 2016 fundraising, in turn, was used to refinance a A$150m three year bullet facility sealed in 2014, which was to fund the power company\u2019s acquisition of a 50% stake in Macarthur wind farm in Australia from Meridian Energy.\n\nMalakoff started as a plantation company, before switching focus to operate in the power sector.\n\nIRFC taps Japanese\n\nliquidity for $300m\n\nIndian Railway Finance Corp has returned to the Samurai loan market for a $300m-equivalent deal.\n\nMizuho, MUFG Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp are the three mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners, according to bankers.\n\nThe loan has a tenor of seven years with a bullet repayment structure \u2014 shorter than the 10 year deal the company sealed last year. It offers a margin of 90bp over JYP Libor.\n\nMandated lead arrangers committing \u00a52bn and more receive a 21bp fee for 93bp all-in, and lead arrangers committing \u00a51bn to \u00a51.9bn receive 10.5bp as fee for 91.5bp all-in. No participation fee will be offered to the arranger group, so lenders committing \u00a5500m and \u00a5900m make an all-in of 90bp.\n\nA banker close to the situation said the reason for zero participation fee at the arranger level is because the leads believe the pricing is sufficient. He said that a number of banks have already shown an interest in it.\n\n\u201cThere is no strategy for the distribution of the deal,\u201d said another banker on the trade. \u201cThe pricing is good and the tenor is OK. We already received some responses, so I think it will have a successful syndication.\u201d\n\nIRFC will use the money to buy rolling stock.\n\nThe deadline for commitments is mid-July.\n\nIRFC closed a $233.6m-equivalent Samurai loan with a 10 year maturity last September. The three Japanese mega banks only attracted three participants during syndication, according to Dealogic data. Pricing details of that facility were not disclosed.", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": ",kawah,ctcbk,cmsnbk,citic,", "source_code": "EURMCM", "industry_codes": ",ibnk,i814,ifinal,i81402,i85,icre,ireest,", "modification_datetime": 1563167135000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585470885948, "region_codes": ",china,chinaz,easiaz,asiaz,pakis,apacz,bric,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1561593600000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",icbk,cogrdn,wlb,ckwbl,chevbk,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
