They will lead a delegation of Pakistani businessmen at the forum today at Four Seasons Hotel.\n\nDawood said that the visit of Pakistani delegation was in follow-up of Prime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s visit to Qatar in January this year. The visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan was very constructive and we left with a great sense of satisfaction,\u201d he added.\n\nSharif said that there existed a lot of opportunities for Qatari businessmen to invest in sectors including tourism and hospitality, food, agriculture, technology, engineering, real estate etc. In the forum, Pakistani companies will also discuss opportunities of investment in Qatar with Qatari officials and private business entities,\u201d he added.\n\nDawood said that Pakistan would welcome Qatari investment in Pakistan\u2019s power sector. We have two recently launched gas-based power plants in Bhikki and Haveli Bahadur Shah that can be privatised for foreign investment,\u201d he said, adding that both power plants with 1200MW power generation capacity were great investment opportunity for Qatar, the largest exporter of LNG in the world.\n\nDawood, who enjoys status of federal minister in Imran Khan\u2019s cabinet, said that investment opportunities in Pakistan were in two categories. In the category one, we are looking for investment from Qatari companies and Qatar Investment Authority and these projects are large scale projects and of strategic nature like in the power sector while for the private business entities of Qatar there also exists a wide range of options,\u201d he added.\n\nRegarding ease of doing business in Pakistan, Dawood said that Pakistan had introduced a number of incentives for foreign investors. By making investment in special economic zones, investors can avail a number of concessions and lucrative incentives,\u201d he added.\n\nSharif said that Pakistan\u2019s tourism and hospitality sector was witnessing a significant growth and Pakistan\u2019s new liberal visa regime for tourists would further augment the pace of growth. This offers an opportunity to foreign investors to invest in Pakistan\u2019s fast growing tourism and hospitality sector,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that Pakistan was set to showcase investment opportunities for Qatari public sector companies in three major sectors namely hospitality, aviation and real estate.\n\nDawood said that Pakistan government would soon announce an attractive package for overseas Pakistanis through which they would be able to invest in country\u2019s tourism and hospitality sector and the government of Pakistan would ensure availability of finances for them through banks at lower interest rates.\n\nDawood said that Pakistan\u2019s energy need was on the rise demanding more imports of LNG for which the country was developing two new terminals. He hinted that Pakistan could sign new pacts with Qatar for more LNG import in future.\n\nSharif said that after Prime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s visit to Qatar in January, Board of Investment was in constant touch with Qatar Investment Authority and was proposing different strategically important projects to Qatari side. Things are set to move to next transaction level very soon,\u201d he added.\n\nSharif said that the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CEPEC), one of six corridors under China\u2019s One Belt One Road initiative, would prove as a magnet to pull investors from the region and world to Pakistan.", "subject_codes": ",gvexe,e511,gdip,gpol,e51,ecat,gcat,gpir,gvbod,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "PINSUL", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1552207528000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585477369282, "region_codes": ",pakis,qatar,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,gulfstz,indsubz,meastz,sasiaz,wasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1552176000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
