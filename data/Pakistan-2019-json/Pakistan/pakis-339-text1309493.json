There are 26 stations including 24 elevated stops and two underground stations. It is expected to cut travel time by more than 70 percent, Xinhua reported.\n\nThe Xinhua News Agency described the project as a token of China-Pakistan friendship and a project that provides a high-class transportation service of international standards.\n\nZhou said the system will bring benefits to commuters and office workers in the city while the roomier train compartment provides ready access to an area exclusively for women.\n\nZhou predicted the tickets for such a service will be priced at an affordable level to allow the maximum number of citizens to use it.\n\nNow into its sixth year, the focus of CPEC has shifted from addressing Pakistan's energy shortage woes to public transportation.\n\n\"The rolling out of an electrified subway system showed that Pakistan's energy issues are being effectively addressed,\" Zhou told the Global Times.\n\nThe system will have a total of 27 sets of energy-saving electric trains, with air-conditioned cabins and an operating speed of 80 km per hour.\n\nIt is expected to transport 250,000 passengers daily when it is fully operational in the first half of 2020, according to Xinhua. With another two rail lines, the Lahore Metro system is expected to transport half a million people daily by 2025.\n\nThe project funded by the Export-Import Bank of China is part of the CPEC and is built by a joint venture of China Railway Corporation and China North Industries Corporation.", "subject_codes": ",gtrans,gcat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "GLOTWE", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1576197036000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585467366839, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,laho,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1576108800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",ruoc,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
