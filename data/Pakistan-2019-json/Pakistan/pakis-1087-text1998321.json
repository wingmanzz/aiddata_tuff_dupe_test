The move is considered to be a major step forward under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\n\nThe test run was made across Lahore via a 25-kilometer route. There are 26 stations including 24 elevated stops and two underground stations. It is expected to cut travel time by more than 70 percent.\n\nThe system will have a total of 27 sets of energy-saving electric trains, with air-conditioned cabins and an operating speed of 80 km per hour.\n\nIt is expected to transport 250,000 passengers daily when it is fully operational in the first half of 2020.", "subject_codes": ",gtrans,gcat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "NBFSTA", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1576487398000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585473700908, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,laho,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1576454400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
