The authorities will use trucks to pick the cycles and redistribute them at stations where they are needed.\n\nA spokesman of TransPeshawar Manzoor Khan said, the management will also be able to track the location of the cycle via a built-in positing system.\n\nA fool-proof security system has been formulated to prevent theft, he said adding, further to enhance the safety of riders, bicycles will be chain-less and safe pedals will be used.\n\nThe company will have a distinctive reward system built for the web, mobile, system apps to encourage good behaviour, he added.\n\nCustomers who take bicycles from relatively full stations or return bicycles to relatively empty stations will be rewarded.\n\nThe bicycle sharing system will have bicycle stands at each station and at popular locations along the corridor to facilitate passengers.\n\nThis follows the introduction of bicycle renting systems on university campuses where students can rent bicycles through a mobile application and can just leave them when done and the company can track them with built-in positioning systems.\n\nBike renting is already done in other countries like China, where it's used extensively in Beijing. This is great for getting around town, especially for short-distance trips that can be done easily on a bicycle without getting stuck in traffic.\n\nAnd this has been made really easy, as you can use BRT's mobile application to book your bike. He said this bicycles sharing project will be fully environment friendly in city.", "subject_codes": ",ccat,gtrans,gcat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "NBBALU", "industry_codes": ",iautlsg,i84,ibcs,", "modification_datetime": 1570782157000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585469633617, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1570752000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
