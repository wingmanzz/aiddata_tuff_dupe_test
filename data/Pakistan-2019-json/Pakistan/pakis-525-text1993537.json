The water reservoir will also control river flow and minimize intensity of floods downstream, therefore, the reservoir will be a great source of flood's protection and save fertile land from erosion.\n\nEfforts are being made to launch work on Diamer Bhasha dam by end of this year.\n\nDiamer Bhasha Dam is also a multi-purpose project aiming at water storage, flood mitigation and power generation. The project will be constructed across River Indus about 40-kilometer downstream of Chillas City.\n\nA total 272-meter high Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) Dam would have a gross water storage capacity of 8.1 million acre feet (MAF) and will generate 4500 MW of electricity with annual energy generation of more than 18 billion units of low-cost.\n\nWith the construction of Diamer Basha Dam Project, the life of Tarbela Dam will be enhanced for another 35 years.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that Pakistan receives around 142MAF water annually through western rivers of which 104MAF used for irrigation purposes. Similarly, approximately 40MAF water is obtained from normal rainfall and 40 per cent through underground water per year.\n\nPakistan is the only country with diversity in weather, rainfalls, landscape, forests, climate, and mountains with capacity to construct 1000 small dams.", "subject_codes": ",gnrsca,gdroug,gflood,gcat,gdis,genv,gntdis,grisk,gwea,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "TRADAR", "industry_codes": ",i17,i5020011,i502,iconst,icre,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1566290275000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585485087182, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1566259200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
