Initially, when Pakistan was to be placed in the grey list, the consensus was broken by China, Turkey and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Under FATF's rules, three members is the minimum requirement for breaking the consensus. Subsequently, Pakistan was placed in the grey list after China and GCC withdrew their objections.\n\nWhile action taken by Pakistan against terror financing and UN-sanctioned groups and individuals will be discussed at the FATF's plenary meeting in Orlando during June 20-21 under the US presidency, the critical call will be taken in October when Pakistan's \"all-weather ally\" will be heading the powerful watchdog. \"IfPakistandoesn'timprove its position, then its move to seek a multi-billion dollar bailout from the IMF will be in jeopardy,\" a senior official said.\n\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.", "subject_codes": ",gtfin,gterr,gcat,gcns,gcrim,gfinc,ncat,nfact,nfcpex,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "HNTM", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1560220370000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585465794036, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,usa,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,namz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1560211200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",fnactk,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
