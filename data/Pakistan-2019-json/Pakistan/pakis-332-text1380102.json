All the victims are believed to be Pakistani.\n\nProvincial home minister Mir Zia Langov told AFP a full-scale investigation had been launched into the attack and to track down the gunmen, who he said had fled the scene.\n\n\"Such incidents are intolerable and we will not spare the terrorists who carried out this dastardly attack,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minster Imran Khan also condemned the killings in a statement from his office.\n\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which came less than a week after a suicide blast in provincial capital Quetta killed 20 people.\n\nBalochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, is Pakistan's largest and poorest province, as well as the site of Islamist, sectarian and separatist insurgencies.\n\nThe Islamic State group is also active in the province, and claimed last week's attack targeting ethnic Shia Hazaras in a fruit market in Quetta.\n\nThe Pakistani military has been targeting insurgencies in the province since 2004, and has been repeatedly accused by international rights groups of abuses there. It denies the allegations.\n\nBalochistan is also the site of the flagship project of the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\n\nThe massive infrastructure project seeks to connect the western Chinese province of Xinjiang with the Arabian Sea port of Gwadar in Balochistan.\n\nBut it has also drawn its share of attacks, particularly by Baloch separatists who have long complained that residents of the province do not receive a fair share of profits from the project.\n\nViolence in Pakistan has dropped significantly since the country's deadliest-ever militant attack, an assault on a school in the northwestern city of Peshawar in 2014 that killed more than 150 people -- most of them children.\n\nBut militants still retain the ability to carry out attacks, and analysts have long warned that Pakistan is yet to tackle the root causes of extremism.\n\nmak-jaf/st/gle", "subject_codes": ",gcrim,gterr,gcat,gcns,ncat,nfact,nfcpex,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "AFPR", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1555567249000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585478845462, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1555567228000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": "Quetta, Pakistan, April 18, 2019 (AFP) - "}
