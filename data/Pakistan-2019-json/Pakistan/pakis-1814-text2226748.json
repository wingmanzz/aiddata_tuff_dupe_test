Last month, China disbursed $4 million for the Orange Line Metro project and $49 million for the Havelian-Thakot Road project of CPEC. China's total disbursement in July stood at $54.2 million.\n\nThe Mainline-I project of Pakistan Railways is the only mega scheme of CPEC that has remained unimplemented so far. Owing to the stringent conditions attached by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the roughly $9-billion project is unlikely to be executed in the near future.\n\nPakistan received $173.3 million in two commercial loans from Dubai Bank and a consortium led by Credit Suisse. Both loans have been obtained at floating London Interbank Offered Rates.\n\nDubai Bank disbursed $123.3 million in July out of the total committed amount of $325 million. Credit Suisse disbursed $50 million out of its total commitment of $250 million.\n\nPakistan's gross external financing needs are assessed at a minimum $25.6 billion by the IMF for the current fiscal year. The assessment is based on projected current account deficit of $6.6 billion in this fiscal year.\n\nIn July, Pakistan booked $579 million of current account deficit, down from $2.1 billion in the same month of previous fiscal year.\n\nOwing to the $13.5-billion current account deficit and nearly $11 billion worth of loan repayments, Pakistan borrowed a whopping $16 billion through foreign loans in the last fiscal year aimed at avoiding default on international debt obligations and financing its imports.\n\nAs compared to the low loan disbursements by multilateral creditors in the past, last month the country received $212.2 million from them, which was nearly half of the total disbursement.\n\n2\n\nThe Islamic Development Bank disbursed $137 million under the oil credit facility out of the total of $551 million.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) disbursed $15.8 million last month. It has already approved $500 million in programme loan and the amount will be reflected in August data. The World Bank released $41.5 million last month.\n\nWorld Bank official meets Shaikh\n\nThe World Bank country head on Thursday met with Adviser to Prime Minister on Finance and apprised him of the difficulties in approval of new project loans and delay in the award of contracts.\n\nThe World Bank has been raising the issue of delay in approval of projects by competent Pakistani forums. But the issue has remain unresolved that has delayed the approval of new projects besides affecting disbursements for ongoing projects.\n\nPatchamuthu Illangovan, Country Director of the World Bank in Pakistan, also apprised the finance adviser of the visit of World Bank President David Malpass to Pakistan in the first week of November, according to a statement issued by the finance ministry after the meeting.\n\nIllango conveyed a desire of the World Bank management to work with Pakistan to drive institutional reforms and support growth agenda of the government through any technical or financial assistance required from the bank, it added.\n\nIllango said the World Bank could work on any financial arrangement looking at the objective need and assessment of the policy matrix as the bank was very supportive of the institutional reforms being undertaken by the government of Pakistan in different sectors of the economy.\n\nHe also briefed the adviser on ongoing discussions with the Ministry of Finance on two policy-based lending operations to provide budgetary support to Pakistan, which would be finalised by December 2019.\n\nAdviser to Prime Minister on Finance Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh said Pakistan was pursuing a growth-oriented programme by undertaking institutional reforms, and technical and financial assistance of the World Bank was vital for achieving various development goals in different sectors of Pakistan's economy.", "subject_codes": ",gvtre,gcat,gpir,gpol,gvbod,gvexe,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASETRI", "industry_codes": ",i814,ibnk,ifinal,iibnk,", "modification_datetime": 1566559636000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585467531111, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1566518400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",cnfina,sk,sbpak,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
