since a total of 3,240MW of capacity had been added to the countrys national grid, constituting for over 11% of total installed capacity in Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, the research agency highlighted the 392-kilometre Multan to Sukkur section of the Peshawar-Karachi motorway, a key CPEC project is over 80% complete and is slated to finish by August this year.\n\nFitch Solutions believes continuing Chinese involvement in the countrys construction market will be positive in the shape of timeliness and implementation and will continue to enhance the growth of the construction industry in the near future.\n\nTalking about the debt related concerns to CPEC projects, the research agency said they will start to decrease on the back of improving transparency.\n\nIt highlighted a media report published in December 2018 pertaining to Pakistans governments debt to China purportedly given to be in the region of $40 billion.\n\nIn response to this, Pakistans Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform followed by the Chinese embassy in Islamabad released statements clarifying the total value of the above-mentioned 22 early harvest projects finished and under construction to be around $18.9 billion, said Fitch Solutions.\n\nMoreover, $6 billion of loan which accounted for 32% of total value were provided by the Chinese government and will be repaid over 20-25 years from 2021 at an interest rate of around 2%, said the report.\n\nAccording to Samiullah Tariq, Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited (AHL), the report from Fitch Solutions has clarified a lot of doubts regarding transparency of CPEC financing and would help take the project forward besides making it more sustainable.\n\nTransparency is good for all stakeholders, financiers, government media etc.\n\nHowever, the data was already available in bits and pieces, its just that it has been provided in a collective form and disseminated, he added.\n\nAs per its assessment of the Chinese embassy and Ministry of Planning statements, Fitch Solutions said it observed an improvement in terms of transparency of CPEC projects considering China also shared a breakdown of the type of financing and the projected investment for each project.\n\nIt noted this was a welcoming sign for the countrys construction industry as demands for greater transparency over CPEC projects are now being addressed by authorities.\n\nAlso, the research agency feels this would provide assurance for potential investors in the countrys construction industry.\n\nIt said the improved transparency regarding CPEC projects will aid Pakistans efforts in the renegotiation of an IMF bailout, which if sanctioned could provide its struggling economy with much required economic relief.\n\nAs per the research agency projection, the real growth of Pakistans construction will average at 8.9% over the next five years.\n\nFitch Solutions indicated it would revise their projections to include possible positive ripple effects across the economy, including the construction industry, in the event an IMF bailout is secured.\n\nFurthermore, it shared that political risks linked with CPEC projects have decreased.\n\nPreviously, we note that the transition in power from Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) posed a downside risk to the Pakistani construction industry as new Prime Minister Imran Khan pledged to review Chinese backed projects, which could potentially have led to project delays and cancellations, said Fitch Solutions.\n\nBut it said the political situation in Pakistan since then had stabilized and Prime Minister Imran Khan has shown an inclination to cooperate with China on various issues including CPEC.\n\nIt concluded that the downside risks arising from political uncertainty were falling and bilateral project lead by CPEC will get a boost in terms of policy implementation and project continuity.", "subject_codes": ",cactio,c174,c172,c17,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ITPNT", "industry_codes": ",icre,", "modification_datetime": 1548686177000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585482837559, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1548633600000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
