They want this to be settled down before making a meaningful investment in Pakistan,\u201d he said. Making investment after the likely rupee depreciation in the near future would earn them better exchange rate and they can wait for a couple of months to let the rupee-dollar parity settle,\u201d he said.\n\nWe anticipate the rupee to touch Rs150 to the US dollar by December 2019 from around Rs139 at present,\u201d he said. The government may let the rupee depreciate to the anticipated level in one or two rounds or gradually over the year.\n\nWe see the current rupee-dollar parity as fair enough at present.\u201d Pakistan recorded a notable drop in FDI in three major sectors i.e. power, construction and financial business in the first seven months of FY19.\n\nOn the other hand, oil and gas exploration, electric machinery, car manufacturing and power services attracted higher FDI.\n\nThe communication sector, mainly telecommunication, continued to record divestment. Aslam pointed out that China had remained a major investor in Pakistan\u2019s power and construction sectors under its multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.\n\nHowever, the Chinese investment has slowed down for different reasons including the fact that a couple of projects, mainly in the power sector, were nearing completion.\n\nWhile a boost in oil and gas exploration activities in the country may be the outcome of new investment, most of this investment has come from foreign companies.\n\nFor example, ExxonMobil of USA and Italy\u2019s Eni in partnership with OGDC and PPL have recently started offshore drilling near the Karachi coastal area,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nFDI in the power sector dropped 63% to $233.8mn in the seven-month period compared to $625.2mn in the same period of last year.\n\nInvestment in the construction sector decreased 25% to $288.9mn compared to $386.2mn last year.\n\nFinancial businesses attracted $216.7mn, which was 29% lower than $303.3mn in the previous year.\n\nFDI in oil and gas exploration increased to $145.1mn compared to $121.6mn.\n\nElectric machinery attracted $126.4mn compared to $13.8mn; car manufacturing received $69mn compared to $35.5mn and power services attracted $44.8mn compared to $2.1mn in the corresponding period of last year.\n\nDivestment in telecommunication rose to $146.2mn in Jul-Jan FY19 compared to $16mn in the same period of last year.\n\nChina remained the single largest investor with $825.5mn in the seven months ended January 2019 followed by the United Kingdom with $127.4mn investment.\n\nSouth Korea invested $68.3mn, Japan $66mn, the UAE $58.5mn and the Netherlands $56.8mn.", "subject_codes": ",efdi,e51,e511,ecat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "GUTIME", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1550605262000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585467631849, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1550534400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",sbpak,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
