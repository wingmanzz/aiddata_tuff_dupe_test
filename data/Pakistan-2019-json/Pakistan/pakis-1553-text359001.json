Even if loan payments are deferred they are going to hang over Pakistan's economic development potential, hamstringing Prime Minister (Imran) Khan's reform agenda. The lack of transparency can increase CPEC cost and foster corruption, resulting in an even heavier debt burden for Pakistan,\" she added.\n\nWells cited a 2018 report by Pakistani senate committee which \"expressed astonishment' at what it called the control bidding process for the construction on the recently inaugurated Multan Sukkar motorway. As per the report, Beijing had allowed only three firms -- all Chinese -- to participate in that tender, while the entire project was financed by the Chinese loans \"with the risk entirely born by the people of Pakistan.\"\"Now given the lack of transparency that road project has unsurprisingly been the subject of corruption allegations against officials from the previous government,\" Wells said.\n\nThe CPEC is a multi-billion dollar development project, with a planned network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with Pakistan's strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea.\n\nAddressing the claim that CPEC has helped in creating jobs in Pakistan, Wells said that the project relies primarily on Chinese workers and supplies even amid rising unemployment in Pakistan.\n\n\"For these projects (under the CPEC), the Chinese companies are importing materials and equipment from China, rather than giving that business to Pakistani companies, which could have given jobs to locals,\" Wells said.\n\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Asian News International.", "subject_codes": ",gcorrp,gcat,gcrim,gfinc,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "HNASNI", "industry_codes": ",i5020041,i502,iconst,icre,", "modification_datetime": 1574382371000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585486680458, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,usa,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,namz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1574380800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",oblrve,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
