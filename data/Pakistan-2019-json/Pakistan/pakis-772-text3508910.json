His meeting with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in the Chinese capital was the high point of his visit. Earlier, he met with his counterpart Li Keqiang and discussed a range of issues before they inked the deals. Under the Main Line-1 railways project, a double railway track will be laid from Peshawar to Karachi. The speed of trains on the new track will be around 160 kilometres per hour, said Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid. Also noteworthy is the conclusion of the second phase of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which promises to give Pakistan's exports to China a much-needed shot in the arm.", "company_codes_relevance": "", "body": " Other agreements relate to cooperation in the field of marine sciences and Rashakai SEZ joint venture.\n\nDuring the meeting, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's unwavering support to Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity and appreciated the government's agenda for socioeconomic development and people-centric progress.
