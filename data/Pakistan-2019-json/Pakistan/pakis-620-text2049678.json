China is investing heavily in Balochistan under the CPEC.\n\nThe CPEC, launched in 2015, is a planned network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China's resource-rich Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with Pakistan's strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea. India has raised objection over the CPEC as it passes through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n\nThe COPHC and its four subsidiaries are responsible for operating the seaport and its economic zones for a period of 23 years.\n\nThe concessions had been guaranteed in the Gwadar Port Concession Agreement but the successive governments were not notifying them. However, President Arif Alvi on Monday promulgated two ordinances to set up China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority and Tax Laws Amendment Ordinance 2019.\n\n\u201cI believe Gwadar will be the largest contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in seven years,\u201d said the chairman, adding that 95 per cent of the production in the Gwadar Free Zone would be exported.\n\n\u201cWe have completed the master plan of the Gwadar Free Zone that will be built in four phases over a period of seven years,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cOnce the zone is fully developed in seven years, 47,000 jobs will be created for the locals, and its annual sales will be USD 1 billion,\" the COPHC chairman said.\n\nOn the troubles faced in reaching this point, the COPHC chairman said, \u201cToday is a big day and I had to struggle for seven years to secure these tax concessions, which had been promised in the Gwadar Port Concession Agreement. I had been running up and down for seven years and everybody made promises with me but nobody helped.\u201d\n\nCOPHC got the support of the National Development Council \u2013 a joint civilian and military body \u2013 upon whose directions the obstacles were removed in obtaining these concessions.\n\n\u201cSo far, 41 investors have come forward to invest about USD 500 million in Gwadar Free Zone in the first phase,\u201d said the port operator. \u201cThese industries are being set up in sectors of logistics, edible oil, piping, and halal food.\u201d\n\nHe said the USD 500 million investment would create 5,000 jobs for the locals in phase one alone, adding that the free zone developer had made it binding for the investors to complete the physical infrastructure in six months and start production within one year.\n\nThe port operator said that in order to promote advanced technology-based industries in the Gwadar Free Zone, the developer might offer free plots, cheap financing, and free housing facilities to such investors.
