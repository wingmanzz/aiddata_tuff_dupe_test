Foreign exchange reserves increased to a comfortable level, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe latest commercial lending by China has pushed the gross official foreign exchange reserves to double-digits after a year.\n\nOn Thursday, the State Bank said that Pakistans total foreign exchange reserves increased to $15.70 billion on March 15. These include $8.83 billion reserves held by the State Bank and $6.87 billion reserves available with the commercial banks.0\n\nThe financial support package for Pakistan is currently being worked out it will be more than what extended by Saudi Arabia in terms of financial grant, Deputy Head of Mission at Chinese Embassy Zhao Lijian told reporters in November last year.\n\nThe government was able to secure back to back aid packages from Saudi Arabia and the UAE during Prime Minister Imran Khans visits to these countries last year.\n\nThe Saudi government has dispatched the $3 billion it had pledged in support of our foreign exchange reserves. The UAE, on the other hand, has sent $2 billion and will send another $1 billion soon.\n\nAs Pakistan started receiving these loans, the dollar became stable. However, the current level of reserves, $8.8 billion, is still below the sustainable level.
