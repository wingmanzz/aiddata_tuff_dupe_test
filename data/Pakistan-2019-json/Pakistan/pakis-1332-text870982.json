He will also get an opportunity to meet several other foreign leaders because the forum will attract heads of state/government and senior leaders from 37 countries.The absence of India, which is expected to boycott the forum, will also offer an opportunity for unhindered lobbying over the recent cross-border missile exchanges and the Masood Azhar controversy.", "company_codes_relevance": ",stndpr,oblrve,imonf,", "body": " But there are limits to which he can present Pakistan\u2019s case.Pakistan is both a showcase for China\u2019s BRI as well as a liability. Beijing can hardly pride itself over the fact that its biggest infrastructure investment is in a country facing turbulent financial conditions and suffered a downgrade in Standard & Poor\u2019s ratings last month.Loans taken by Pakistan from China and Saudi Arabia have made it difficult for Islamabad to obtain an IMF loan. The country\u2019s finance minister, Asad Umar, recently resigned over differences with PM Imran Khan on this issue.Khan, who will be accompanied by a ministerial delegation, is scheduled to deliver a speech at the opening ceremony of the Belt and Road Forum and participate in the Leaders\u2019 Round Table. He will also address a Pakistan trade and investment conference in Beijing.\n\nFor Reprint Rights: timescontent.com", "subject_codes": ",e212,gdip,gpol,greg,e21,ecat,gcat,gpir,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "TOI", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1555709517000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585478722080, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,beijin,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1555718400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",oblrve,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
