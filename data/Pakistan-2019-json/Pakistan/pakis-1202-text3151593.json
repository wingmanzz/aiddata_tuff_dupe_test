The contract was signed by Moonis Alvi, CEO, KE; Dr. Keramat Fakhari Executive Vice President, Siemens and Guo Yu, Chairman, Harbin Electric International Company Limited. Although the project timeline has been affected due to delay in finalization of KE's multi-year tariff, the power utility is determined to execute it on a fast track and additional power to be made available by summer 2021.", "company_codes_relevance": ",trexsv,smns,ngrid,", "body": "With an investment of USD 650 Million, the project will be built at KE's Bin Qasim Power Complex and includes upgrades to associated transmission infrastructure. It will be dual fired with RLNG (Re-gasified Liquid Natural Gas) as the primary fuel and represents one of the largest private sector investments of its kind in the country's power sector. In line with our vision of improving KE's generation fleet efficiency, the 900MW BQPS-III is one of several planned projects to replace older plants with newer and more efficient units. The project is part of KE's business plan formulated after detailed study to review all possible solutions for increase in generation capacity including long term off-take of additional power of national grid with the objective of bridging the supply demand gap and decommissioning of its old furnace oil based BQPS-I plan.\n\nAccordingly, in addition to this project, KE is also in talks with Government of Pakistan to increase the supply from National Grid and in this regard discussions for supply of 500MW from KANUPP-2 and KANUPP-3 are in advanced stage. It is pertinent to note however, that construction of interconnection facilities will take at least two years once the proposal is approved by GoP, which is still pending. Further a key coal-fired 700 MW Project - awaits notification from the Government of Pakistan. All these planned initiatives are of utmost importance to not only bridge the demand-supply gap in Karachi but to also allow KE to replace older, inefficient furnace oil-based units with new lower cost and efficient generation units to lower the burden on consumers and on the national exchequer.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion Moonis Alvi, CEO K-Electric said, 'The 900 MW BQPS-III is essential in meeting Karachi's future energy demands.", "subject_codes": ",c332,c33,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPKOB", "industry_codes": ",i5020042,i5020044,i502,iconst,icre,i3302,i342,ielec,iindele,iindstrls,itech,", "modification_datetime": 1571910436000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585464935503, "region_codes": ",pakis,heilon,apacz,asiaz,bric,china,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1571875200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",trexsv,smns,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
