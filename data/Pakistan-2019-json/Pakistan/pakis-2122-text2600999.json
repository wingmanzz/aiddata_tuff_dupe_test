Deposits grew 7% in 2018, despite Pakistan\u2019s grim economic environment and a change of government. This year, HBL made PRs1 trillion in advances for the first time; another benchmark, having received double that in annual deposits in 2015 \u2013 the first Pakistani bank to achieve both levels. That speaks to how dominant HBL is in Pakistan; 11 million customers accessing 1,700 branches for a market share of 15%.\n\nIf Imran Khan\u2019s new government delivers even half what it promises, Aurangzeb says HBL is poised to soar even higher \u2013 and put the New York setback well behind it.\n\n\u25b2 Back to top\n\nBest corporate and investment bank: HBL\n\nIn a faltering economy, HBL\u2019s corporate and investment banking business managed to stand tall in 2018.\n\nThe commercial banking side experienced record growth, as its lending book expanded 21% in 2018 against the previous calendar year. At the end of 2018, HBL\u2019s lending book was tracking at a record high of PRs63.8 billion ($460 million).\n\nWith a large number of China-devoted desks at the head office in Karachi, the capital Islamabad, and uniquely for a foreign bank, in China\u2019s western metropolis Urumqi, HBL has positioned itself for a bonanza from the massive China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) infrastructure programme. HBL\u2019s investment banking business, run by Farhan Talib, says it closed 10 transactions, worth a total of over $3.5 billion, between September 2017 and September 2018.\n\nNotable deals by the bank included advising Pakistan\u2019s first private-sector transmission line project; this is the CPEC-related, 878-kilometre circuit that is delivering power to Lahore, Pakistan\u2019s second-biggest city, and is a $1.7 billion project backed by the world\u2019s largest utility, China\u2019s State Grid Corporation.\n\nAnother big CPEC deal advised by HBL was the $520 million Thar Energy coal station in provincial Sindh, in Pakistan\u2019s south. As of November 2018, HBL has managed $6 billion worth of CPEC business, and that number looks set to rise.\n\nIn November, HBL tied up with China\u2019s largest investment bank, China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC), to jointly provide investment banking services to Pakistan and Chinese companies.\n\n\u25b2 Back to top\n\nBest international bank: Standard Chartered\n\n\n Shazad Dada, Standard Chartered\n\n\nIn Pakistan, when it comes to international banks, there is Standard Chartered \u2013 and then there\u2019s daylight. Shazad Dada\u2019s outfit has been in the country since 1863, and has recently seen off StanChart\u2019s traditional competitors in the south Asia region, notably HSBC and Citibank (the latter the alma mater of so many Pakistani bankers).\n\nChinese state-owned banks have appeared in the market of late, as Beijing and Islamabad ratchet up their love affair over the $50 billion China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor project, but these new faces have yet to challenge StanChart.\n\nIn calendar 2018, and in the face of an increasingly grim economy, StanChart\u2019s Pakistan operation produced its highest-ever pre-tax profit \u2013 up 37% to PRs18.5 billion ($133 million) from the previous year. Overall revenue growth was 12%, the bank says, and client revenue jumped by 13% with strong contributions from transaction banking, financial markets and retail deposits. It helped that Dada kept a check on expenses, which rose 5% during the year.\n\nAnother milestone was achieved when the bank\u2019s total deposits exceeded PRs400 billion ($2.9 billion), up 13% across the bank\u2019s 77 branches in 11 cities.\n\nStanChart is one of the go-to banks at the top end of town. Some 54% of the companies that comprise the Pakistan Stock Exchange\u2019s PSX-100 index use StanChart for their payroll requirements, and 76% of them use the bank\u2019s corporate division.\n\n\u25b2 Back to top\n\nBest for premium banking services: Standard Chartered\n\nIn a country where the wealthy have always preferred to have their cash offshore \u2013 in Dubai, Singapore or London \u2013 Standard Chartered pioneered domestic wealth management in an effort to keep it at home. And that\u2019s been a good strategy for a London-based bank that, by dint of its colonial heritage, operates with a local mandate in Pakistan, allowing local access with perceived international solidity.\n\nIt\u2019s been a good year for StanChart\u2019s Priority Banking operation, as the bank claims it has increased its priority-qualified clients by over 70% during the period while assets grew 74%. Deposits were 30% higher year on year in calendar 2018, and revenues grew 16%.\n\nWith a new government in Islamabad now frowning on capital flight and urging Pakistanis abroad and at home to invest in the motherland, the good times look set to continue for Shazad Dada\u2019s team.\n\n\u25b2 Back to top\n\nBest digital bank: Telenor Microfinance Bank\n\nBest for microfinance: Telenor Microfinance Bank\n\n\n Shahid Mustafa, Telenor Microfinance Bank\n\n\nThe central State Bank of Pakistan calculated that branchless banking in Pakistan grew roughly 10% in the three months to the end of September 2018, the most recent period reviewed, with a total of 43.1 million accounts.\n\nSome 2.5 million transactions are conducted daily through mobile devices. Similar growth was observed in branchless banking deposits during the quarter: these rose 8% to reach PRs16.5 billion ($118 million).\n\nIn Pakistan, the lion\u2019s share of that expanding market belongs to Telenor Microfinance and its digital arm, easypaisa. Indeed, digital and microfinance have tended to go together in Pakistan ever since Norwegian telecom firm Telenor took full control of microfinance pioneer Tameer in 2016.\n\nLeveraging Telenor\u2019s status as one of Pakistan\u2019s biggest mobile phone carriers, easypaisa reaches the parts of Pakistan that the big banks in Karachi can\u2019t or won\u2019t get to, offering the unbanked a portfolio of financial services: payments, e-wallet savings, transfers, even rudimentary insurance. As many as half of those daily transactions are made through the easypaisa platform.\n\nAnd Telenor Microfinance promises to be even more ubiquitous: in November, the Pakistani authorities approved the acquisition by China\u2019s Alibaba of a 45% shareholding in the bank for $184.5 million. The Chinese are expected to channel their Alipay platform through the Telenor network, reaching beyond the poor who use Telenor for microfinance to the massive so-called \u2018sandwich layer\u2019 with semi-formal financial arrangements, believed to number up to 100 million in Pakistan.\n\nTelenor Microfinance will push on without its popular chief executive, Shahid Mustafa, who stepped down in February: at the time of going to press, his permanent successor had not yet been appointed.\n\n\u25b2 Back to top\n\nBest bank for SMEs: JS Bank\n\n\n Basir Shamsie, JS Bank\n\n\nFour years since JS Bank relaunched its SME business, the strategy is paying off. While the small and medium-sized enterprise business at much bigger rival HBL might be larger, JS Bank\u2019s SME division is now ranked the third largest in the country and is attracting attention \u2013 and compliments \u2013 from competitors for the rapid emergence of its shrewd relationship-centred operations.\n\nChief executive Basir Shamsie measures JS Bank\u2019s SME portfolio at PRs47 billion ($340 million) as of the end of 2018, up a stunning 155% in the last year.\n\nIt claims a \u201crevolutionary\u201d partnership-driven model that results in one of the lowest non-performing loan ratios in the Pakistani SME sector of less than 2%. With increased focus by the new Imran Khan government on financial inclusion, one interesting initiative by JS Bank was to tie up with foreign aid-funded investor and incubator Karandaaz (\u2018entrepreneur\u2019 in Urdu). Not-for-profit Karandaaz is funded by the UK government\u2019s aid programme and the Gates Foundation, and has joined with JS and its national network to provide easier access to funding for SMEs.\n\nJS Bank has also partnered with Washington\u2019s USAid to drive SME funding.\n\n\u25b2 Back to top\n\nBest bank for CSR: HBL\n\nHBL is controlled by the philanthropic foundation of the Aga Khan, the billionaire spiritual leader of the Ismaili branch of Shia Islam: so not surprisingly, corporate and social responsibility is considered part of the bank\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe bank is mandated to contribute 1% of its annual taxed profit to the HBL Foundation, which was established in 2009 to promote the development and well-being of the underprivileged in Pakistan, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries.\n\nHBL\u2019s new chief executive, Muhammad Aurangzeb, told Asiamoney that the philanthropic side is very important to him; as an Aga Khan-funded scholar to an Ivy League American college (Wharton), he feels compelled to give back to society. In 2018, HBL donated PRs128 million ($920,000) to the foundation and other direct causes, focussing on health and education.\n\nFor example, 29 doctors at Karachi\u2019s Indus Hospital undertook emergency training, and are now providing free health care to the public.\n\nThe bank financed free eye surgical camps set up by the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Center in the remote Baluchistan and Gilgit-Baltistan regions, serving 15,000 patients.\n\nHBL also partnered with a range of hospitals and clinics serving the poor, and urged staff to become blood donors.\n\nIn education, HBL financed skills development in collaborations with the influential Helping Hands Welfare Association and various national charities. HBL support has also financed a new museum for the Citizens Archive of Pakistan in an underprivileged area of Lahore.\n\n\u25b2 Back to top", "subject_codes": ",e52,ecat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "EURMY", "industry_codes": ",i81402,i831,i814,ibnk,ifinal,iinv,", "modification_datetime": 1555305447000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585480666389, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1553472000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
