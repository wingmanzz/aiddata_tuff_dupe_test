'If Pakistan is successful in capturing even 10pc of this market share, our exports to China could straight away increase by $6 billion.'\n\nThe adviser urged the business leaders to exercise their potential in penetrating the Chinese market.\n\n'We have to pursue import substitution to protect our local industry. The first phase of Pak-China FTA lacked proper safeguard measures but now on our request, the Chinese authorities have incorporated those measures in the second phase,' he said.\n\nCommerce Secretary Sardar Ahmad Nawaz Sukhera on the occasion reiterated that the government is committed to promoting ease of doing business and reducing the cost of doing business so as to help accelerate the pace of exports. He added that the Ministry of Commerce is striving to address all business and export-related issues.\n\nA large number of traders from Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat and Sialkot chambers and trade associations participated in the seminar.\n\nMeanwhile, Dawood said that inflation was taking place globally and not just in Pakistan.\n\nAddressing another ceremony in the provincial capital, the PM's aide said in order to curtail inflation, all departments would need to work together.\n\nHe added that steps were being taken to bring Pakistan's economy on the right path and the government was taking decisions which would bring results.\n\nThe PM's adviser further said that the loss-making government institutions would need to become profitable, warning of privatization if they failed to do so.\n\nAccording to Dawood, the government would not take any step that could prove harmful for people. 'Imran Khan's vision is to provide relief to people but this will take time,' he stated.\n\nDawood said during the last five years, numerous industries closed while exports fell, but former finance minister Ishaq Dar failed to take any notice. The past governments had concealed facts from people, he accused.", "subject_codes": ",e512,gdip,gpol,e51,ecat,gcat,gpir,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPTOD", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1557150042000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585481090929, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1556928000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
