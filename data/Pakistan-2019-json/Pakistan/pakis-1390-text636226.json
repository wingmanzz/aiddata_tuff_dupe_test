LCCI President said that all system constraints should be removed to avoid power shutdowns for the industrial sector keeping in view the hot weather and power supply burden. He said that DISCOs should have sufficient stock of transformers, cables, polls and all other necessities to keep the things under control.\n\n'Industrial sector is the ray of hope for economic stability of the country. It needs all kinds of support from the government including uninterrupted electricity supply so that it can bring more foreign exchange to the country besides providing jobs to the people', he said.\n\nLCCI Senior Vice President Khawaja Shahzad Nasir and Vice President Faheem-ur-Rehman Saigal said that country has witnessed some serious power failure incidents due to over-burdening which not only plunged country into darkness but also caused huge loss to the industry. To avoid any untoward incident, all weaknesses of power transmission and distribution system should be removed.\n\nThey urged the authorities not to tolerate any laxity towards the upgradation of power transmission and distribution system as any negligence could cause huge loss to the trade, industry and economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Karot hydropower project, being developed on build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), is scheduled to be completed by the year 2020.\n\nThe project was launched at the end of 2015 and after completion, it will be operated by the construction contractor for 30 years. Afterward, the ownership will be transferred to the Pakistani government at no cost, according to a report of Chian.org.cn here on Thursday.\n\nWith an investment of US $1.74 billion, the power station will have an installed capacity of 720MW and an average annual output of 3.2GWh, equivalent to 10 percent of Pakistan's total hydroelectric power generation in 2017.\n\nThis will provide reliable energy support for economic and social development. In addition to power generation, it will help flood prevention and sediment control, and improve downstream and reservoir area transport services.\n\nThe project is expected to create more than 2,000 new jobs during the construction period, and will spur coordinated and upgraded development in related sectors.\n\nThe Karot hydropower project is located on the Jhelum River, one of the rivers of the Indus River System in northern Pakistan, about 55 kilometers east of Islamabad.\n\nIt is the first hydropower project implemented under the Belt and Road Initiative, and the first project financed by the Silk Road Fund since its inception in 2014.\n\nIt is also one of the priority projects of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the largest greenfield investment project ever undertaken overseas by a Chinese company.", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "AIWNAT", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1556004949000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585464739269, "region_codes": ",pakis,laho,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1555977600000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
