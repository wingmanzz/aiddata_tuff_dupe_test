Overseas Pakistanis have highly appreciated this scheme and within less than two weeks period, more than 5 thousand people have been registered and investment worth $ 1 million has received from just 50 people.

Government estimates $ 1 billion investment through PBC till June 2019.\n\nThe Former Minister said that foreign remittances received in the seven months of ongoing fiscal year stood at $ 12.5 billion having an increase of $ 1.5 billion from the same period of previous year.

Muhammad Bin Salman visit has lead to huge investment of $ 21 billion in different sectors, which will benefit both countries. A mega oil refinery will be established in Gwader which will reduce Pakistan\u2019s import bill by approximately $ 1.5 billion and will enable KSA to grab growing Pakistani market in addition to export of surplus oil products to other countries in the region.\n\nThe Veteran Business Leader while talking to the business community said that the short, medium and long term Saudi investment in power, renewable energy, petrochemicals, infrastructure, mining, tourism and hospitality is comprised of $ 7 billion, $ 2 billion and $ 12 billion respectively.

Recent reduction in KSA visit visa fee for Pakistanis is appreciative but business visas should also be offered at cheaper rates in order to make it convenient for Pakistanis to meet Saudi traders and investors easily.\n\nMian Zahid Hussain said that the idea of forming Pak \u2013 Saudi Coordination Council under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman will benefit the trade and economic ties between brotherly countries. Saudi ambassador to Pakistan H.E. Nawaf Bin Said Al Malki and counsel general to Sindh H.E.

Pak Saudi coordination council and Pak Saudi joint chamber of commerce should take measures for increased exports to KSA. The Pak Saudi coordination council should closely monitor the investment status in Pakistan to ensure the practical implementations of investment proposals.

Pakistan enhanced the role of modern technology against terror financing, money laundering and smuggling which FATF itself acknowledged in a meeting held in January 2019.\n\nThe Former Minister said that India has started blaming Pakistan for Palwama incident without any evidence and its media is constantly busy in lobbying against Pakistan. Prime Minister Imran Khan has deliberately offered assistance on the basis of concrete evidences; his speech on the incident was voice of nation wherein he strongly condemned the Indian media and government blaming Pakistan for terror attacks.\n\nMian Zahid Hussain said that Pakistan has formed several laws and implemented new regulation to fight terror financing and money laundering but political support is vital to avoid black listing by FATF from the friendly countries including China, Saudi Arabia, UAE and EU as US and India are strongly in efforts of blacklisting Pakistan.\n\nMian Zahid Hussain said that economic challenges of Pakistan will be increased further if Pakistan is included in the FATF blacklist. Multilateral monitory institutions including IMF, WB and ADB will stop financing, interest rate will rise and FDI will be adversely affected given to shaking investors\u2019 confidence.
