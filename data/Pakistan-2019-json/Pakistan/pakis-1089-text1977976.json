The delegation will interact with the local business community. It is expected that some other private level agreements will also be inked during the visit,\" the BoI chief said.\n\nTalking about an oil refinery that Saudi Arabia will set up at Gwadar, Mr Sharif said the facility will be established at a cost of 8bn dollars. \"Besides foreign investment, it will also provide job opportunities to the locals of the port city. If they [Saudis] also establish a petrochemical complex along with the refinery, it will require an additional investment of billions of dollars,\" he added.\n\nThe BoI chief said the Saudi government was keen to install an oil refinery at Gwadar and further urged the preparation of a feasibility report in this regard.\n\nResponding to a query regarding China's reaction over Saudis investment in Gwadar, Mr Sharif said the former had no objection over the latter's plan to establish an oil refinery. \"In fact the area where Saudis will install the refinery will exactly be determined after feasibility study. However, it will be far away from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),\" he claimed.\n\nResponding to a question as to why Saudi Arabia has suddenly come up with huge investment plans in Pakistan, the board's chairman said, \"The leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan and his commitment of ensuring transparency in Pakistan are the reasons behind much ambitious foreign investment in the country.\"\n\nSource: Dawn website, Karachi, in English 12 Feb 19", "subject_codes": ",nnam,gdip,gcat,gpir,ncat,nfact,nfce,niwe,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "BBCSAP", "industry_codes": ",i1,", "modification_datetime": 1549952412000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585471890095, "region_codes": ",pakis,saarab,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,gulfstz,indsubz,meastz,sasiaz,wasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1549952144000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
