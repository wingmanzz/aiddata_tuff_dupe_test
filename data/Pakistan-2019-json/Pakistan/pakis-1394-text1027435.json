It has done marvels over the last decade by lifting over 100 million people out of misery. The governance system in China gave special attention to infrastructure development, energy self-sufficiency, and human development. The Chinese success story in improving its underdeveloped areas is a role model for Pakistan, especially Balochistan. The province of Balochistan has been facing socio-economic issues. Since the Pakistani government is prioritizing economic take-off by encouraging investment in infrastructure, energy and human development; a comprehensive plan in line with the Chinese development model should be adopted for Balochistan. It is prudent to draw lessons from the Chinese experience. The Chinese political system lays emphasis on development needs of the local populace.", "company_codes_relevance": ",twban,", "body": " It has launched several projects in its backward region 'Xinjiang' which includes improving housing conditions, developing education, boosting healthcare, and providing sanitation facilities.\n\nThe Chinese Premier Xi Jinping intends to lift around 30 million more out of poverty by 2020. He has also encouraged the private sector to invest for ameliorating the situation in poor areas. China has worked out a very creative solution for investment and poverty-alleviation in its poor areas especially Xinjiang. The under-developed area was linked with other cities and towns in order to increase investment in this province. The Chinese government has adopted 'pairing assistance program' whereby 19 Chinese provinces and municipalities are allocated a certain proportion of their budget to assist Xinjiang every year. China has focused on urban development, and placed massive road and rail networks in the far-flung areas. However, it is unfortunate to realize that Balochistan was neglected in the past by the successive Federal governments. Moreover, the province has seen scandals of corruption and misappropriation at all the levels. There was no proper system of accountability, which means all the development funds and resources ended up in waste. In contrast, the Chinese accountability in Xinjiang is so strict that any evidence of corruption led to capital punishment. Resultantly, it has succeeded in raising the standards of road infrastructure and connectivity. Pakistan can apply such strict measures in Balochistan for effective utilization of resources. The Federal government can do the same by urging the governments in Punjab, KPK and Sindh to allocate certain amount of fund for poverty alleviation in Balochistan.\n\nThe Baloch areas can become a hub of economic activities owing to its natural and mineral resources. The development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) will provide job opportunities to the Baloch youth. The local unemployed people can become an efficient labor force for these industries. Another field where Pakistan can learn from the Chinese experience is to promote tourism. The sector of tourism can be lucrative for Balochistan as it boasts one of the ideal places to attract the local and foreign tourists. It can positively boost the per capita income of the province. Similarly, the export of agricultural products and dry fruits is another way of generating local economy. Moreover, the method of online marketing can be used efficiently. Apart from the abovementioned areas, the Chinese government has particularly invested in the health sector of Xinjiang keeping in view its lower living standards. A study of the 'World Bank' emphasizes on investment in 'basic health units' and 'social safety programs' for poverty alleviation. For this, China has provided air ambulances to rural areas where patients can be shifted to main health centers in no time. Likewise, the government of Pakistan should make arrangements for the provision of air ambulances in Balochistan which can be used in the hilly areas.\n\nThe Chinese military has strengthened the security measures in the far-flung rural areas especially Xinjiang in order to curb radicalism, terrorism and extremism. China did not pay any heed to the negative propaganda being projected by the Western media, and continued working on its reforms. The Balochistan government can learn lessons from the Chinese de-radicalization process. The entire Baloch segment should be included in the national mainstream so that they may lead a normal serene life, enjoying the social benefits. It is also plausible for the concerned quarters in Pakistan to engage the Chinese government to emulate its development model in Balochistan. It is fortunate that the Chinese government and its embassy in Islamabad have special consideration for uplift of the province. The Baloch people can benefit from the huge Chinese investment under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.", "subject_codes": ",gpov,gcat,gcom,gsoc,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASNHTE", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1550557848000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585470358464, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,xinji,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1550448000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
