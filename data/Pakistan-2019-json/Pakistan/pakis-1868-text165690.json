The major coal-powered plants use super-critical thermal technology, which is the most advanced environmental control technique for coal-fired plants currently.\n\nEach project has got the approval of environmental impact assessment by the Pakistani government before the construction.\n\nWith the introduction of CPEC energy projects, Pakistan also reduced its heavy dependence on gas and LNG power plants, which account for 50% of total installed capacity.\n\nThe CPEC energy projects are a foreign direct investment based on commercial contracts, which are in accordance with the standard clauses provided by the Pakistani government.\n\nThe CPEC energy projects are executed in accordance with BO(O)T mode. The financing of the energy projects is mainly provided by the equity of Chinese companies and commercial loans which borrowed from China Development Bank and other commercial banks in the rates of around 5%.\n\nIn another word, any debt arising from CPEC energy project would be borne by the Chinese investors instead of the Pakistani government.", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "NBFSTA", "industry_codes": ",i1610108,i326,iwind,i1610107,i1,i16,i16101,i163,i32,ieutil,iindstrls,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1549267775000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585484883955, "region_codes": ",pakis,kash,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1549238400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
