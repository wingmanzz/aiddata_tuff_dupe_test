Far from adding to Pakistan's burden, the CPEC actually strengthened the local economic structure,\" Lu explained at his regular news conference in Beijing.\n\n\"Leveraging international financing to carry out major projects, as a common practice across the world, is an effective tool for developing countries in particular to overcome the funding bottleneck and boost growth,\" the Chinese spokesman stressed.\n\nCPEC will ultimately give landlocked western Chinese regions the shortest and a more secure route to international markets through Gwadar port.\n\nIslamabad acknowledges the corridor investment has improved transportation networks and effectively resolved years of crippling power crisis facing the country. Pakistani officials reject as misplaced concerns the current foreign debt crisis stems from the project.\n\n\"CPEC is great opportunity for Pakistan. CPEC connects us to China which is one of the biggest markets and CPEC route will connect China and Pakistan located at strategic position of world,\" Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan told a recent international conference.\n\n?Groundbreaking\n\nKhan traveled to Gwadar a week ago, where he performed groundbreaking for several new infrastructure development projects, including an international airport in the coastal city, marking the start of the new phase of CPEC.\n\nThe airport, which will have a 12,000-meter runway, will be completed in three years with a Chinese financial grant of $250 million. It will be capable of handling aircraft such as an Airbus A-380, linking the once sleepy town of Gwadar to some of the world's major destinations.\n\nSaudi Arabia also announced in February plans to build a $10 billion refinery and petrochemical complex in the city.\n\nPakistani and Chinese officials admit CPEC is behind schedule. They cited problems such as legal and administrative procedural delays in their respective countries and the recent political transition in Pakistan that brought Khan's party to power last August. But those issues have been settled now, they say.\n\nThe \"Chinese say they can easily and quickly deliver loans, but financial grants require to go through a time-consuming legal process, that's why the work on Gwadar airport could not be started in time,\" a Pakistani official told VOA.\n\nThe newly launched phase of \"broadening and expanding\" CPEC projects, officials say, will see the construction of nine industrial zones across Pakistan with the help of Chinese financial and technical assistance that will boost bilateral industrial cooperation between the two countries.\n\nSome industries to relocate\n\nChina plans to relocate some of its industries by transferring technology to the new industrial zones to help Islamabad increase its exports to overcome its massive trade deficit and shore up cash reserves.\n\n\"CPEC has gained momentum and efforts would be made to continue the same pace in the future,\" said Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar, the Pakistani minister for Planning, Development and Reform who is overseeing the project.\n\nOfficials said the groundbreaking of construction of the first industrial zone at Rashakai, in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, is expected before Prime Minister Khan travels to China later this month for bilateral meetings and to attend the second BRI summit along with 40 foreign leaders in Beijing. The launching of Rashakai will mark the \"implementation stage of the Pakistan-China Industrial Cooperation,\" said Minister Bakhtyar.\n\nBeijing has extended a loan of more than $4 billion during the current financial year at an interest rate of 2 percent to help Islamabad boost its depleting foreign cash reserves.\n\nThe Chinese government has recently pledged an additional grant of $1 billion for education, health, vocational training, drinking water and poverty alleviation projects in Pakistan.\n\nWhile Beijing and Islamabad have traditionally maintained close defense ties, both the counties say their deepening economic cooperation in recent years has cemented the overall relationship.\n\nYour opinion", "subject_codes": ",gcat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "VOA", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1554805900000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585464307373, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,beijin,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1554681600000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",oblrve,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
