Ning said the port city can be transformed into the most important logistics hub in the region, so as to bring more benefits to the people of Pakistan.\n\n\n Chairman of Gwadar Port Authority Naseer Khan Kashani thanked China for the support, saying the potential of Gwadar is to some extent the future of Pakistan.\n\n\n On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy in Pakistan, Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing donated solar energy facilities and school uniforms respectively to the local people in Gwadar and the Faqeer school during the inauguration ceremony.\n\nEnditem", "subject_codes": ",c24,cprdop,ccat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "XNEWS", "industry_codes": ",i5020017,i5020044,i502,iconst,icre,", "modification_datetime": 1572944800000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585464638152, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1572944121000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
