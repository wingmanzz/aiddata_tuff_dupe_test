He said if I get a degree from there, I would get a job at Gwadar port or any other project in the city,\" said the 13-year-old student who along with his friends came to see the groundbreaking.\n\nSource: Xinhua news agency in English 1136 gmt 16 Dec 19", "subject_codes": ",gplan,ghea,nnam,gdip,gcat,gpir,gpol,greg,ncat,nfact,nfce,niwe,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "BBCAPP", "industry_codes": ",i5020017,i5010024,i501,i5010023,i502,iconst,icre,", "modification_datetime": 1576514610000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585476271223, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1576514549000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
