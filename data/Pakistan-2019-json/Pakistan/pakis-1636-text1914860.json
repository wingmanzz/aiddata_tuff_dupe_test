'Around seven million Pakistanis are estimated to be eligible to pay income tax, but practically only less than 0.5 million people pay the tax,' he added.\n\nChina, the socialist state has fulfilled the needs of society from cradle to grave. Childcare, education, job placement, housing, subsistence, healthcare and elder care were largely provided and administered through state-owned enterprises.\n\nParticularly, the reform of value-added tax (VAT) had boosted China's service sector and developed its position as the 'world's factory', he said.", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "NINTPK", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1557921797000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585472593569, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,laho,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1557878400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
