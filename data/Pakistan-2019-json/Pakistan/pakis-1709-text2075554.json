The agreement signing had taken place earlier at a ceremony in Shenzhen, China, for which a delegation of Directors of Pakistan Stock Exchange, led by the Chairman PSX, Mr. Sulaiman S. Mehdi paid a visit to China.\n\nThis is to clarify that in the said press briefing, the Chairman, Pakistan Stock Exchange had stated that there is potential to attract Chinese investors' interest in the Pakistani Capital Market and Bonds in view of the attractive valuations compared to the regional markets. However, there are capital control restrictions by the Chinese Government regarding foreign investments. It was further stated that the Chinese investment in our Capital Market could be possible subject to relaxation of such restrictions.\n\nFurthermore, the Chairman PSX, Mr. Mehdi, informed the media representatives gathered at the press briefing that the said matter of relaxation of capital control restrictions may be taken up by the relevant authorities of both the countries at an appropriate forum. For this purpose, Pakistan Stock Exchange is pursuing and will always be at the forefront to facilitate the same.
