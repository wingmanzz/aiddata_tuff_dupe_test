With the latest tranche, Chinas support to Pakistan in this fiscal year alone would surge to $4.5 billion. Last July, China had lent $2 billion to the State Bank of Pakistan, which is that countrys central bank.\n\nIn the last fiscal year (2017-18), Pakistan had obtained $2.2 billion from three Chinese commercial banks China Development Bank, ICBC China and Bank of China apart from getting $1.8 billion from Beijing on a bilateral basis.\n\nThe Chinese money is coming as part of the governments strategy to have support till the time its macroeconomic situation stabilises, people tracking the financing deals told ET.\n\nAfter coming into power, Prime Minister Imran Khan had visited China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE to arrange emergency loans to avoid a default. Pakistan has secured $14.5 billion of commitments from these three countries that have largely helped bridge its external financing gap in the ongoing fiscal year.\n\nSaudi Arabia has agreed to provide a $6-billion financial assistance package, which includes $3 billion in short-term loans at an interest rate of 3.18%. The UAE has agreed to provide $3 billion at an interest rate of around 3% and has already disbursed $1 billion. A $3.2 billion of oil facility on deferred payment is also being awaited.\n\nBut despite $4 billion inflows from Riyadh and the UAE in past two months, the gross official foreign currency reserves stayed at only $8.12 billion as of December 25, according the State Bank of Pakistan. This is sufficient to cover just seven weeks of imports and is below the minimum level that the International Monetary Fund and World Bank prescribe. Due to this, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are not providing loans for budget financing.\n\nPakistan has also borrowed heavily from China for various projects under the China-Pak-Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship project under BRI.\n\nChina has become the biggest lender to Pakistan after surpassing Japan. Pakistan owes $19 billion (a fifth of its total debt) to China. The CPEC loans will add $14 billion to Pakistans total public debt, raising it to $90 billion by June 2019, abating its economic ability to service huge amount of debt, said experts.\n\nAccording to experts calculation, Pakistan will have to payback $100 billion to China by 2024 of total investment of $18.5 billion, which China has provided as bank loans for 19 early-harvest projects, mostly relating to the energy sector under the CPEC.", "subject_codes": ",e1119,e11,ecat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "EMNEAG", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1549622001000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585462928253, "region_codes": ",pakis,saarab,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,gulfstz,indsubz,meastz,sasiaz,wasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1549584000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",sbpak,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
