(PMLTC).\n\nSpread over 878 kilometers, the capacity of this transmission line will be 4000 MW at 660 KV voltage, the officials briefed.\n\nThe project is designed to have bi-pole HVDC technology, having two convertor stations, one each at the end of Matiari (Interior Sindh) and Lahore, three repeater stations and two grounding electrode stations.\n\nPPIB issued Letter of Support (LOS) for the Project to PMLTC on August 4, 2017 and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) granted Special Purpose Transmission License to PMLTC for the Project on February 18, 2018.\n\nThe project agreements i.e Implementation Agreement (IA), Transmission Services Agreement (TSA), Land Lease and Right of Way Agreement (LLA), Implementation Agreement and Guarantee Direct Agreement (DIA), TSA Direct Agreement (TSADA) etc. have already been signed by the respective entities.\n\nThe project entails an investment of US$ 1.658 Billion. After fulfilling mandatory prerequisites and completion of all financing arrangements, the project has successfully achieved financial close.\n\nThe project which is scheduled to achieve commercial operations by March 2021 would be executed on Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis, and will be transferred to NTDC after a term of 25 years.\n\nThis transmission facility will primarily be utilized to transmit power generated from indigenous Thar coal based power generation projects, thus enhancing the share of indigenous fuel based generation and saving significant amount of foreign exchange.\n\nWith the medium and long terms plans of power induction into the national grid, it is important that the power transmission infrastructure is made available to transport the electricity from the power generation facilities to the load centers.\n\nPPIB Is playing vital role in private sector resources mobilization for large power generation and transmission infrastructure projects, and Matiari-Lahore HVDC transmission project is one such example.\n\nIn addition to this HVDC project, PPIB is currently facilitating implementation of power projects having cumulative capacity of 10,934 MW under CPEC Agreement which include various hydel and coal based projects.", "subject_codes": ",c24,ccat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPKOB", "industry_codes": ",i5020042,i16,i502,iconst,icre,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1551348069000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585484735026, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1551312000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
