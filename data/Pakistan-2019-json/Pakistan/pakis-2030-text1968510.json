The latest deposits came from Beijing are expected to boost the SBP reserves into double digit after a gap of almost one year.\n\nThe comparatively higher imports than exports and debt repayments did not allow the reserves to stay stable, as the government was partially financing such international payments using the reserves. This was despite Pakistan's overseas workers sending notably higher remittances during the first eight months (July-February) of the current fiscal year.\n\nApart from this, Riyadh has also enabled a $3 billion petroleum oil supply line on deferred payment for Pakistan as well.\n\nEarlier, the UAE had announced a $6-billion package for Pakistan in December 2018 including $3 billion in cash deposit and a credit line of another $3 billion for the supply of petroleum oil on deferred payment. However, Pakistan has not been able to secure the $3.2-billion oil on deferred payments facility from the UAE.\n\nMeanwhile, Finance Minister Asad Umar on Monday said an agreement will soon be reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nWhile speaking to journalists in Islamabad, Umar said Pakistan had not changed its stance in talks with the IMF. He added that the IMF had revised their stance and \"the gap\" between the IMF and Pakistan had decreased.\n\nOn a related note, the finance minister said gas and electricity prices will increase gradually as subsidies are withdrawn, adding that the government subsidy on gas and electricity will not be withdrawn together. He also added that the new IMF mission chief is to arrive in Pakistan tomorrow (March 26) for an introductory visit.\n\nOn March 16, Umar had hinted that bailout package talks with the IMF are in their final stages and the government will have further negotiations with the newly appointed IMF mission chief before reaching an agreement.\n\n\"Pakistan has come closer to reaching an agreement with the IMF as the differences between Pakistan and the IMF over a possible bailout package have decreased,\" he had said.", "subject_codes": ",c341,e1119,c13,ccat,e11,ecat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASMPAK", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1553595775000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585481001265, "region_codes": ",pakis,uae,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,gulfstz,indsubz,meastz,sasiaz,wasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1553558400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",imonf,sbpak,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
