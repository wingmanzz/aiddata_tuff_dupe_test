He expressed confidence that rule of law will rather help boost economy in the country.\n\nThe Finance Minister said the last PML-N government made jugglery with economic figures, and the same has been exposed by independent economists like Dr. Hafiz Pasha in their articles.\n\nHe said economic growth rate will get increased, but immediately after taking over the charge of affairs, the government had to face serious challenges of low central bank reserves and huge current account deficit.endorsing reforms proposed by Dr. Hafiz Pasha for economic progress of the country, Asad Umar said almost all the suggestions presented by the renowned economist are part of the government's agenda.

He said data is being integrated by various government departments for the purpose. He said the process of tax payment will also be simplified through new laws.\n\nEarlier highlighting key features of his book, Dr. Hafiz Pasha said the book provides timely guidance to improve national economy, and his ten-point economic agenda can serve well in this regard.\n\nHe pointed out state capture of the elite, tax exemptions and privileges particularly to the feudal lords, and irritants in ease of doing business as main issues facing the national economy.
