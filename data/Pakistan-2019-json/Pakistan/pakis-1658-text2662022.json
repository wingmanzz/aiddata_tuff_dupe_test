Apparently Iran is being cordoned but actually it is Pakistan. This time battlefield will be seawater along Gwadar approaching to Gulf of Persia. American Aircraft Carriers are present in the seawater of Pakistan and Iran. American B-52 fighter jets are ready to ruin Iran. American B-52 fighter jets are believed to be the most catastrophic. The same jets had been used in Iraq and Afghanistan. It can carry the heaviest bombs to the height of fifty thousand meters. Another devastation in the region is on American cards. Before attacking Afghanistan in 2001, former American President Bush threatened Pakistan 'whether you are with us or against us?' Surprisingly the then President General Pervez Musharraf at once unconditionally decided to be with America against Afghanistan. Now once again Pakistan is facing the same sort of situation in case of Iran.", "company_codes_relevance": ",nato,", "body": " Pakistan very soon will again be asked by present American President Trump' whether you are with us or against us '. What will be response of Premier IK to America then?\n\nOn his official visit Iranian Foreign Minister Jawad Zarif has asked Pakistan for its cooperation with Iran. But viewing history of Pakistan it clearly looks that Pakistan can't deny American demand and will offer its logistic support to America against Iran from Balochistan. America will offer a few dollars to crumbling Pakistan which will be accepted. We once again would provide our shoulders to America against Iran as we had done against Afghanistan during last two decades. Pakistan supported America against Afghanistan resultantly on one hand Afghans fought against America and on the other started attacking Pakistan thus martyring over seventy thousand Pakistani innocents including over twenty thousand security forces personnel. Pakistani nation is still facing backlash of that America Afghanistan war. This time if Pakistan again decides to provide military and air bases to America against Iran, Pakistan will face same sort of retaliation from Iran. Then on one side Iranians will fight against America in the Gulf and on the other they will teach lesson to Pakistan. Here, repeating its history again Pakistani nation will pay the price of supporting America. Communal riots, target killings and suicidal attacks will once again jolt the foundations of Pakistan. America very successfully is playing its cards in the Middle East, Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Muslims are divided on economic and sectarian bases.\n\nPakistan-Iran Gas Pipeline has been wrapped up. Terrorism in the country especially in Balochistan has once again started. CPEC is made non operational amid several dangers and doubts. Eight terrorist attacks in Balochistan during current month, closing of Pakistani oil well drilling in deep sea water very near to Gwadar and just 300 nautical miles away from Iran, and tension around Gwadar sea water are cards of American new war game design. America is not quitting from Afghanistan after devastation of two decades. Now it's coming to Pakistan and Iran in waters of Gwadar for another havoc. Middle Eastern countries and NATO will again join American hands against Iran. Pakistan will provide bases to America against Iran while Russia and China will support Iran against America. On American pressure Pakistan has very easily finished Iran-Pakistan Gas Pipeline project. According to Iran-Pakistan Gas Pipeline agreement, Pakistan could not complete this worthy project on its territory. So according to the agreement Iran is demanding one million US dollars penalty per day for not completing this gigantic project within given timeframe. This fine makes a sum of 1.5 billion dollars without using gas from Iran. Pakistan has refused to pay even a penny of fine to Iran. It has created very unpleasant situation between Pakistan and Iran. Now if Pakistan doesn't pay fine to Iran and provide bases to America against it what will be the level of relationship between these two nations?\n\nIndia is the biggest ally of Iran in the region but it has decided to stop procurement of oil from it. India procures ten percent of its required oil from Iran but now it has decided to do no more trade and business with Iran. Where will India stand then? Definitely America will give dominant role to India against Iran, Pakistan and CPEC. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman will stand which way? The clear answer is America. Where will stand China and Russia? The answer is Iran. China because of CPEC favours Iran but Pakistan will favour America against Iran in Balochistan. It will enhance serious level of mistrust between Pakistan and China. If Pakistan decides to provide bases to America against Iran in Balochistan CPEC will remain non functional for long years. America has been in Afghanistan for the last two decades. Here, in the name of Iran it will remain more than two decades to contain CPEC.\n\nKnowing that Saudi Arabia and Iran are worst enemies of each other why Saudi Arabia is so quiet on the advancement of American Aircraft Carriers in the Gulf? Where does Saudi Arabia stand in America-Iran war? On the other hand Israel is opposing American attack on Iran. Israel is of the view that US should let Saudi Arabia and Iran fight against each other. Now the matter of concern is this that US will start this war from which of the neighbouring counties. Pakistan, Iraq, UAE or Qatar? Interestingly, like Pakistan, Turkey also shares border with Iran. Where will Turkey stand then? America and Turkey are NATO partners but opponents otherwise. In this situation to whom will Turkey extend its support, Iran or America? In 2023 Turkey will be free from 100 years long sanctions. During last 100 years Turkey made remarkable progress. After the end of these sanctions the momentum of development of Turkey will be matchless. At this stage where does Turkey stand? To get in Turkey, America will have to conquer at least half of Iran first. At this stage Turkey does not seem American target. America wants to get hold of Iran with support of Pakistan through Balochistan.\n\nCPEC is under completion because of Chinese investment. Bear it or not China is emerging future economic power of the world. In this leg pulling what will China do? Definitely, China will not let America enter Balochistan because China has spent billions of dollars on Gwadar port and thus Balochistan. From Gwadar Port via water Iran is on just one hour distance. For America against Iran the most suitable and nearest bordering place is Gwadar but Pakistan and China have not developed Gwadar for America. Worsening situation in the Gulf and fate of Pakistan oil drilling in water near Gwadar and just 300 nautical miles far from Iran tell complete story. Drilling on such a project is always initiated after complete study and homework and assurance of availability of oil. At the time when the nation was waiting for very good news of finding oil Premier IK told us that nothing is found after spending billions of rupees on the drilling. Immediate closing of drilling and then cordoning it can't satisfy the nation. Will IK be able to handle the game of international players in the seawater?", "subject_codes": ",gdip,gpol,gvio,gcat,gcns,gpir,grisk,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPKOB", "industry_codes": ",i1300003,i1,i13,iextra,", "modification_datetime": 1558968766000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585468773633, "region_codes": ",pakis,iran,usa,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,gulfstz,indsubz,meastz,namz,sasiaz,wasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1558828800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
