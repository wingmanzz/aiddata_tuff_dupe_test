The total capacity of Dasu Hydro project is 4320MW and it will be completed in two phases.

Total 9875 Acres of land required for the project which includes 866 Acres for main civil works,1121 Acres for preparatory work and 7888 for reservoir area. ECNEC had approved the land acquisition rates in 2015 which was not accepted by the local land owners. The KP government had then constituted a steering committee and they had fixed the new rates for the land purchase. As per revised plan of cost of acquisition of land increased by around 95 percent from Rs19 billion to Rs37 billion. Due to escalation of land cost, the total cost of the project is likely to go above Rs500 billion and revised cost will be approved soon.", "subject_codes": ",c332,c33,c184,c18,cactio,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "AIWNAT", "industry_codes": ",i1610107,i1,i16,i16101,i163,ieutil,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1574745315000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585470057367, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1574640000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
