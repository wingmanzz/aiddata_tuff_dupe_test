Both projects are also included in list of those entities put on privatisation.\n\nHe said the investment would help reduce the cost of electricity which would make the industrial sector more competitive and boost the exports.\n\nThe advisor said during Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government, investment came in infrastructure and power sectors. As a result, he said, there was improvement in infrastructure of Pakistan.\n\nChairman Saudi Fund and Minister for Finance Asad Umar will sign an MoU related to project financing.
