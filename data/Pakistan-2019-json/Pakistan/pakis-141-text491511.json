Birds are relatively sensitive to environmental changes (Reis et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2016); hence bird diversity and density have become an important indicator to ecosystem and habitat changes (Lv et al., 2007; Larsen et al., 2011). National Yancheng Rare Birds Nature Reserve (Yancheng Reserve), established in 1983, is the largest coastal nature reserve in China. It was included in the Man and Biosphere Reserve Network of UNESCO in 1992. Yancheng Reserve supports a high biodiversity of 1665 faunal species, including 405 bird species such as the Endangered red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis) (Lv et al., 2007; Lv, 2015), and an annual number of migratory birds approximating 3,000,000 (Lv et al., 2007).\n\nHowever, the reserve is under serious pressure from rapid and widespread habitat deterioration, which affected 42% of the core zone and approximately twice that percentage in the buffer zone (83%); by 2003, very little natural wetland was left in the reserve (Ma et al., 2009). This catastrophe threatened the zone's inhabitants, changed the birds' patterns of habitat use, and increasingly concentrated them in the core zone (Su et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2009). As the carrying capacity of the core zone reached its limit, birds have been spreading outward to the buffer zone for the past several years. Although buffer zone is legally treated at par with the core zone (however, buffer zone is often considered secondary to the core zone, which has the highest priority, in terms of species conservation), it is seldom evaluated for bird diversity. Therefore, the birds' population dynamics in the buffer zone remain unclear.\n\nBird density is fundamental to understanding the population dynamics and is commonly used as reference for setting conservation priorities (Newson et al., 2008) and evaluating the importance of functional zones (Tatsuya et al., 2010). Until now, most previous studies on Yancheng birds have concentrated on their distribution pattern and habitat selection (Jiang et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010, 2013; Wang et al., 2015). The scanty bird density studies have focused on limited species, such as the red-crowned crane and Saunders's gull (Larus saundersi), and birds in the core zone (Lv et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2010) and transition zone (Hou et al., 2013). Meanwhile, bird density in the buffer zone was seldom estimated, hence the importance of the buffer zone could not be well evaluated.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nWe conducted a line transect survey to estimate bird density in the buffer zone of Yancheng Reserve. By comparing the density difference between approximate natural (woodland) and complete artificial habitats (farmlands and aquaculture ponds), we assessed the impact of anthropogenic activities on bird population dynamics. Based on the density of protected species, migratory species, and resident birds, we explored the importance of the buffer zone for bird conservation.\n\nStudy sites\n\nThe study sites and field work have been described by Li et al. (2016). Yancheng Reserve is located in the coastal area of Jiangsu Province, East China, 32\u00b034'N to 34\u00b028'N and 119\u00b048'E to 120\u00b056'E, with a 582-km long coastline and 4530 km2 area. The northern buffer zone study area covers 224.9 km2 and comprises three major habitats consisting of woodland, farmland, and aquaculture ponds. The woodland includes natural macrophanerophytes and some planted trees mainly Populus alba.\n\nField work\n\nData were collected with approval from Animal Research Ethics Committee of Nanjing Normal University.\n\nIn the buffer zone of Yuncheng Reserve, almost straight survey lines were established (Fig. 1). The visibility in woodland could be only about 50 m, in aquaculture area about 150 m and in farmlands even more than 150 m during winter (the time of the study). The visibility in the woodland could however be more than 50 m during winter when the scanty deciduous vegetation is leafless.\n\nField survey was conducted from 15th-30th December 2010, upon the arrival of migratory birds. We designed sixteen transect lines ranging from 2.0 km to 12.0 km long spaced at one km interval (Fig. 1) covering all habitat types except for the mudflats due to safety considerations. We traversed a total length of 188.8 km of transect lines however the data obtained from 117.4 km line-transect surveys were used in estimating bird density after intercepting repeated lines.\n\nThree trained observers walked the transect lines from 0730 / 0830 hours to 1300 / 1600 hours at 2-3 km per h depending on the length of the survey line selected. When birds were sighted, the time, sighting angle between transect line and the initial location of the bird, distance (measured directly with an infrared range finder or by GPS), species of the bird, their numbers, and habitat types, were recorded. The birds were photographed as much as possible using a digital camera with a 100-400 mm zoom lens and 1.4 x Tele-converter for further identification. For the identification of bird species, \u201cA field guide to the birds of China\u201d (MacKinnon, 2000) and \u201cA checklist on the classification and distribution of birds of China\u201d (Zheng, 2011) were used; the website of China Bird Gallery (http://old.wwfchina.org/birdgallery) was also consulted.\n\nData analysis\n\nThe bird density of protected birds, migratory birds, resident birds, species, orders, or different habitat types were respectively estimated.\n\nThe density of birds was estimated using DISTANCE 6.0. We used the Conventional Distance Sampling (CDS) engine which employs the flexible semi-parametric detection function modeling framework proposed by Buckland (1992) and Thomas et al. (2010). In CDS engine, four key functions are available: uniform, half- normal, hazard-rate, and negative exponential; and adjustments can be expressed in cosine terms, hermite, or simple polynomials. However, the negative exponential key, which is present in Distance largely for historical reasons, was not recommended for use (Thomas et al., 2010). Therefore, three other models were selected as key functions together with their series expansion: Uniform + Cosine, Uniform + Simple polynomial, Uniform + Hermite polynomial; Half-normal + Cosine, Half-normal + Simple polynomial, Half-normal + Hermite polynomial; Hazard-rate + Cosine, Hazard-rate + Simple polynomial and Hazard-rate + Hermite polynomial.\n\nThe model that best fits the data was selected for each sampling unit line (Burnham et al., 1980) based on the lowest value of the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), and not too many parameters (Buckland et al., 1993, 2001). In this program, the density of bird groups in the area surveyed was estimated using the following equation (Buckland et al., 1993):\n\nD = n x f(0)/2L\n\nWhere, n is the number of birds identified, L is the length of survey line (m), f (0) is the probability density function of the perpendicular distances evaluated at zero whose value is the same with the reciprocal of effective strip width and D is the density of bird groups per square kilometer.\n\nGenerally, the density estimates satisfied the following premises: (i) at least 40 objects were observed via line- transect sampling schemes (Anderson et al., 1979), (ii) birds recorded in the final distance band (100 m or more) were excluded from the analyses (Buckland et al., 2001; Newson et al., 2005) and (iii) birds flying toward the front were excluded to avoid re-counts.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSurvey efforts\n\nIn total, we observed 8067 birds; of these, 5534 individuals were identified and classified belonging to 50 species and 12 orders (Table I). Thirty four protected species, with 4975 individuals were observed in in the three habitats including 127 red-crowned cranes and 868 common cranes. On an average 63.7\u00b141.9 individuals per km survey line were recorded.\n\nThe richest bird order was Passeriformes, which represented about 34% of the total number of species. At species level, tree sparrow (Passer montanus) was the most abundant species, with 1504 (18.64%) individuals sighted.\n\nDensity estimates of each order\n\nOf the 12 bird orders, Density estimates of Galliformes, Piciformes, Pelecaniformes, and Coraciiformes were not attempted because of their few sightings (< 40 individuals). Passeriformes had the highest density with 344.32 individuals/km2, followed by Lariformes, Anseriformes, Charadriiformes, Gruiformes, and Columbiformes, which ranged from 56.86 to 12.15 individuals/km2 (Table II). The density of other two orders was less than 10 individuals/ km2. The density of unidentified birds was 35.68 individuals/km2.\n\nTable I.- The area and survey efforts in three types of habitats in northern buffer zone of National Yancheng Rare Birds Nature Reserve. \n\nHabitat         Area       Survey effort        Total number of\ntype            (km2)   (length of transect      birds counted\n                              lines,km\nAquaculture     115.3          51.45               4470\nFarmland        89.1           54.95               2935\nWoodland        20.5           11.00               333\nTotal           224.9          117.40              7738\n\n\nTable II.- Density estimates of eight orders and unidentified birds, based on alternative Distance models selected on the lowest value of the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). 95% CI, 95% confidence interval for density; SE, standard error; CV, coefficient of variation. \n\nOrder                Model (Key function)        AIC             Density                95% CI         SE       CV (%)    Effective strip\n                                                            (individuals.km-2)                                               width (m)\nPasseriformes        Half-normal+Cosine         2389.9           344.32            243.14 - 487.58    59.11     17.17         17.4\nLariformes           Uniform+Polynomial         282.9            56.86              21.58 - 149.84    28.79     50.62         95.8\nAnseriformes         Uniform+Cosine             266.4            38.31              13.05 - 112.45    21.82     56.95         98.8\nCharadriiformes      Uniform+Polynomial         209.9            30.43               8.07 - 114.82    20.03     65.81         95.8\nGruiformes           Uniform+Hermite            128.5            13.39               4.01 - 44.69     8.20      61.28         98.4\nColumbiformes        Uniform+Cosine             158.8            12.15               6.49 - 22.73     3.74      30.75         44.3\nCiconniformes        Uniform+Cosine             257.3            6.82                3.24 - 14.34     2.61      38.29         71.5\nPodicipediformes     Uniform+Cosine             151.1            4.92                2.60 - 9.30      1.58      32.09         55.4\nUnidentified         Hazard+Hermite             215.7            35.68              13.74 - 92.66     17.84     50.00         4.9\n\n\nInter-specific density estimates\n\nTwelve species were considered for density estimation. Tree sparrow had the highest density among the estimated species with 657.06 individuals/km2 in the study area (Table III), followed by rustic bunting (Emberiza rustica) with 116.40 individuals/km2. The density of other ten species was less than 80 individuals/km2.\n\nDensity estimates of birds in natural and artificial habitats\n\nAll three types of habitats supported high levels of bird density (>200 birds per km2). Furthermore, the original approximate natural habitat (woodland) had the highest density with 372.39 individuals/km2 in comparison to the farmland (326.87 individuals/km2) and aquaculture area (205.75 individuals/km2) (Table IV).\n\nA significant difference was found among the three types of habitats at species level. In aquaculture area, tree sparrow had the highest density with 522.46 individuals/ km2, whereas the density of other seven evaluated species including black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus), coot (Fulica atra), Siberian gull (Larus vegae), pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), common merganser (Mergus merganser), little egret (Egretta garzetta), and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis) ranged from 74.34 to 5.64 individuals/km2 (Table V). In farmlands, the density of tree sparrow and common magpie (Pica pica) was 469.07 individuals/km2 and 13.54 individuals/km2 respectively. In woodland, rustic bunting was mainly observed, with 328.58 individuals/km2.\n\nDensity estimates of protected birds\n\nOf the 50 identified species, 34 species (68% of identified species) were protected species: included in the IUCN red list (n=4), CITES appendices (n=4), national key species (n=4) and/or provincial protected lists (n=30) (Supplementary Table SI).

Overall, the present study focused only on the bird density during winter i.e. the temporal (seasonal and annual) dynamics of bird density was not explored. It is not able to fully reflect the bird density of this nature reserve throughout the year.\n\nHigh bird density and difference in woodland and farmland\n\nThe study confirmed that anthropogenic activities do have a negative impact on bird population dynamics. In farmland, the density was a bit lower than that of the woodland, whereas the lowest bird density was estimated in aquaculture, a probable consequence of the deterioration of natural habitat. This result confirmed that birds tended to use approximate natural habitat than artificial habitat in the specific study site.\n\nThe importance of the northern buffer zone: Comparison with neighboring reserve\n\nAs the bush and swamp densely covered the core zone, conducting line transect survey was impossible. We therefore were not able to estimate the density of birds in the core area. Instead, we referred to the bird density of the neighboring Dafeng Muli National Nature Reserve (Liu et al., 2012) to compare with the bird density in buffer zone. The comparison was meaningful although it was not accurate. Upon comparison, the density of eight species (50% of compared species) in the buffer zone of Yancheng Reserve was found to be higher than that in Dafeng Reserve (Table VI), and of these species, seven were protected. These observations proved the importance of buffer zone in the Yancheng Reserve.\n\nTable VI.- Density of eight species in the northern buffer area of Yancheng Reserve (YR) and Dafeng Milu National Natural Reserve (DMNNR). \n\nSpecies                             Density(individuals.km-2)\n                                     YR                DMNNR\n                                 (this study)    (Liu et al., 2012)\nPasser montanus a                  657.06             243.70\nEmberiza rustica a                 116.40              79.50\nLarus ridibundus a                  74.34              33.00\nFulica atra ab                      26.67              22.60\nLanius schach                       11.32              22.40\nEgretta garzetta a                  10.26              49.60\nPica pica a                         10.03              46.00\nTachybaptus ruficollis a             4.92              10.50\n\n\nProtected and migratory species\n\nThe northern buffer zone has become a vital habitat of 34 identified species, with high density of 1244.60 individuals/km2. Seventeen of the species observed were migratory (Supplementary Table SI). Red-crowned crane, a globally endangered species, was the flagship species in Yancheng Reserve during winter. The population size of cranes in the whole Yancheng Reserve declined largely from 1128 in 1999-2000 to 636 individuals in 2009-2010 (Wang, 1997, 2008, 2010; Wang et al., 2005; Su, 2008; Su and Zou, 2012). The major reasons for the decline in populations were the habitat loss due to reclamation and draining of wetlands, obstruction of water sources of the wetlands, and the reduction in plant biomass (Yang, 2008; Ke et al., 2011; Sun and Liu, 2011). Red-crowned crane population for the past several years has gradually started to recover (Cheng and Zhang, 2015). In 2015, 682 red- crowned cranes were observed in the whole reserve.\n\nOf these encountered individuals, 39.44% were recorded throughout from the northern buffer zone, an increase of 3.65% from the previous record in 2014 (Cheng and Zhang, 2015). Additionally, the northern buffer zone had always been the habitat of the common crane in the past 20 years, and the common cranes record attained in 2015 was 41.21% of the total number of birds in Yancheng Reserve (Li et al., 2013; Cheng and Zhang, 2015).\n\nResident birds\n\nSixteen resident bird species were recorded including little egret, northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), great pied woodpecker (Dendrocopos major), Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris ), great tit (Parus major), Eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops), common coot (Fulica atra), common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyana), tree sparrow, common magpie, little grebe, black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), reed parrotbill (Paradoxornis heudei), and intermediate egret (Mesophoyx intermedia). As these species live in the reserve all year round, habitat management can be an important measure in preventing or reversing the stability of population dynamics. All these results indicate that the northern buffer zone is an important habitat for protected bird species.\n\nTo sum up, considering the high density of endangered and protected species, migratory and resident birds, and diverse habitats, the northern buffer zone of Yancheng Reserve plays an essential role in bird survival and sustainability. Thus, the northern buffer zone should be considered for conservation purposes on priority basis. Conservation status and suggestions\n\nHabitat modifications and losses due to anthropogenic activities occur in all core zones, buffer zones, and transition/experimental zones of Yancheng Reserve, e.g. the natural wetlands decreased in area by 30,601 ha (-6.9%) from 2000 to 2009 (Liu et al., 2013). Currently, the core zone is protected with the highest priority, and anthropogenic activities are banned except for harvesting reed once a year. On the other hand, the buffer zone and transition zone permit some human activities. Interestingly, extensive aquaculture and continuous reclamation exist in northern and southern buffer zones, and continue to increase every year. The aquaculture area contained the highest number of species among three types of habitat, which should make it an area of great concern.\n\nThe bird conservation measures employed in Yancheng Reserve include an annual monitoring survey in the whole reserve since 1982 (Lv et al., 2006), and the establishishment of rescue farms (Li et al., 1999). The results provided reliable and valuable information on bird dynamics and health. In the buffer zone, alternative measures should be carried out to mitigate the possible anthropogenic impacts, especially in aquaculture. In this paper, we suggest preserving the current aquaculture, but strictly prohibiting new reclamation of lands. A certain compromise between local economic development and species conservation must be reached. In future, the buffer zone may be gradually converted into a core zone.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBird density was negatively correlated with the artificial extent of habitat change. Considering high density of endangered and protected species, migratory and resident birds, and diverse habitats, northern buffer zone of Yancheng Reserve played an essential role in bird survival and sustainability. Northern buffer zone should be considered to be given more conservation importance.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to the Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, NSFC for Talents Training in Basic Science (J1103507, J1210025), Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (20093207120006), and Jiangsu Province Wildlife Conservation Station (commissioned projects), which funded the present study.
