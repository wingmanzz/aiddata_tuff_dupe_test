The AIIB, which was created three years ago with a specific mandate to provide development finance in infrastructure and other productive sectors, in its report says the cost of construction is likely to rise in line with the projected depreciation of the rupee.\n\nIn near-term, downward pressure on the exchange rate will drive inflationary pressure and increase the cost of construction materials \u2013 cost-push inflation is gathering momentum and the upward influence on import price inflation from a weaker rupee-dollar exchange rates becoming more evident in the general level of prices.\n\nRoad construction would be less affected by currency uncertainty as the raw materials for highway projects are mainly machinery needs to be imported. In 2019, most projects will focus on transport and energy, with the energy sector primarily driven by China-Pakistan cooperation.\n\nThese are largely power sector projects along the corridor. The government had proposed Rs1.03tn in PSDP for 2018-19 budget, 62% of which is to be spent on infrastructure, with the largest allocation to roads.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether the International Monetary Fund (IMF) financial assistance will affect budget implementations.\n\nThe report says that ongoing development through co-operation with China \u2013 with a total project value of $62bn \u2013 singles that infrastructure development will remain a key economic driver. However, it is unclear whether Pakistan will adopt IMF programme.\n\nShould the IMF programme be adopted, it is possible that IMF evaluation will require greater austerity measures, which may affect planned expenditure, the report says.\n\nAn increase in long-term borrowing costs is expected in the next 12 months due to interest rate pressure and monetary policy announcements by the Pakistani central bank.", "subject_codes": ",ccat,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "GUTIME", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1549402593000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585476775970, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1549324800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",aifvbk,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
