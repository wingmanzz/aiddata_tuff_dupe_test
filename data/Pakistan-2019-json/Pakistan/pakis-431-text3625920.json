On the other hand, portfolio investment was down 19.66pc to $33.9 million, as against a net outflow of $42.2 million in July last year.\n\nFY19 proved to be a dismal year for inflows, as annual FDI dipped 61pc to a modest $1.251 billion, down from $3.23 billion in FY18.", "subject_codes": ",gengsc,gpol,gvexe,gcat,gpir,gvbod,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPTOD", "industry_codes": ",iwteg,i1,i16,i16101,i163,ieutil,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1566564726000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585480591544, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1566432000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
