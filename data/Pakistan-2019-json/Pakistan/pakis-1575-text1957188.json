Speaking at the occasion, an ecstatic Zhao Yonggang, CEO, CPHGC, congratulated the CPHGC team, highlighting that the achievement of this and other milestones was the result of the hard work of both the Pakistani and Chinese employees who are working in harmony to bring success to the Project. China Power Hub Generation Company (Pvt.) Ltd. is the first overseas thermal power project developed by SPIC under the Belt & Road Initiative. The 2X660MW Coal-Fired Power Project is a priority project under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor and is also the first overseas thermal power project developed by SPIC under the Belt & Road Initiative, said Yonggang.\n\nLocated in Hub, Balochistan, the CPHGC Project is a Joint Venture Vehicle between CPIH (the Chinese state-owned company) that owns 74 percent of the Project and HUBCO that owns 26 percent. The project despite the much higher cost has adopted supercritical technology for environment protection, as this technology requires reduced coal consumption and has lower carbon emissions thus improving its economical, energy-conserving and environment protecting features. The $2 billion Project includes a power plant and a dedicated coal Jetty.", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "BAKHNA", "industry_codes": ",imulti,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1546417955000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585462784997, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1546387200000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",ngrid,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
