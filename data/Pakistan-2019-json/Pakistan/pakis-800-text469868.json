Unlike many of the other China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects in Gwadar, the New Gwadar International Airport is not financed by a loan from China but through a Chinese grant,\" cpecinfo.com said in a statement.Scheduled to become operational over the next three year, the new airport will be developed under the guidance of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).Once commissioned, it will become the second largest airport in Pakistan.Pakistan believes that the new international airport, which will operate under the open skies policy, will help Gwadar to emerge as a regional economic hub.The soil testing on the land, which started in January last year, has been completed through 300 boreholes made on various locations.The aviation authorities have already approved the design and work plan for the airport.", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "DTMNTR", "industry_codes": ",i764,itsp,iairtr,", "modification_datetime": 1594344738000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1594437399194, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1554076800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",oblrve,", "action": "rep", "dateline": null}
