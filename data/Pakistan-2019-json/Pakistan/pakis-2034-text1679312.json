In 2019, most projects will focus on transport and energy, with the energy sector primarily driven by China-Pakistan cooperation. These are largely power sector projects along the corridor.\n\nThe government had proposed Rs1.03 trillion in PSDP for 2018-19 budget, 62 per cent of which is to be spent on infrastructure, with the largest allocation to roads. However, it remains to be seen whether the International Monetary Fund (IMF )financial assistance will affect budget implementations.\n\nThe report says that ongoing development through cooperation with China - with a total project value of $62 billion - singles that infrastructure development will remain a key economic driver. However, it is unclear whether Pakistan will adopt IMF programme. Should the IMF programme be adopted, it is possible that IMF evaluation will require greater austerity measures, which may affect planned expenditure, the report says.\n\nAn increase in long-term borrowing costs is expected in the next 12 months due to interest rate pressure and monetary policy announcements by the Pakistani central bank. The new Pakistani government is in talks with the IMF to stabilise its economy.\n\nAlthough the government bond market in Pakistan is sizable, the comparatively meager size of corporate issuances indicates the lack of depth in the country's debt market.", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASDAWN", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1549350579000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585464619367, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1549324800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",aifvbk,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
