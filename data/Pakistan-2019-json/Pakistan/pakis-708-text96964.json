The terms of the package, however, had remained elusive until last week.\n\nAdditionally, Dr Najeeb today said that after receiving the Chinese loan, the foreign exchange reserves held by the SBP had hit the double-digit mark of 10.67bn dollars.\n\nIn a tweet, he added that the net foreign exchange reserves held by commercial banks stood at 6.91bn dollars.\n\nHe said the \"implementation of a successful strategy\" had resulted in the total foreign exchange reserves of the country rising to 17.58bn dollars.\n\nSource: Dawn website, Karachi, in English 25 Mar 19", "subject_codes": ",e1119,nnam,e212,gdip,e11,e21,ecat,gcat,gpir,ncat,nfact,nfce,niwe,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "BBCSAP", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1553570151000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585467345328, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,beijin,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1553570092000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",sbpak,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
