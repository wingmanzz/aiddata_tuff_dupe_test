The military denies the allegations.\n\nBalochistan is also host to a number of major projects under the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\n\nThe massive infrastructure project seeks to connect the western Chinese province of Xinjiang with Gwadar, on the Arabian Sea.\n\nBut it has also drawn its share of attacks, particularly by separatists who have long complained that residents do not receive a fair share of profits from the province's resources.\n\nViolence in Pakistan has dropped significantly since the country's deadliest-ever militant attack, an assault on a school in the northwestern city of Peshawar in 2014 that killed more than 150 people -- most of them children.\n\nBut militants still retain the ability to carry out attacks, and analysts have long warned that Pakistan is yet to tackle the root causes of extremism.\n\njaf/st/amu", "subject_codes": ",gluxtr,glife,gterr,gcat,gcns,gcrim,gtour,ncat,nfact,nfcpex,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "AFPR", "industry_codes": ",i6651,i66,i665,ilea,itourm,", "modification_datetime": 1557583830000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585467707890, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1557583803000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": "Islamabad, May 11, 2019 (AFP) - "}
