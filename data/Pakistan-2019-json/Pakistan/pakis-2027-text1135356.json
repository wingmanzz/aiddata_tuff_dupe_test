Under the circumstances, spot cargos were talked at Yuan 5,200-5,210 and CFR China cargoes were discussed at around $650/mt.\n\nPrices for ethylene glycol (EG) on a CFR China basis strengthened to $565-575/mt on Tuesday, up $10/mt from the previous day. China domestic prices increased by Yuan 65/mt to Yuan $4,830-4,910/mt. Both CFR China and China domestic prices firmed since inventories were drawing down. In addition, there would be limited volumes of imported cargoes to arrive in China this week, which also buoyed the prices.
