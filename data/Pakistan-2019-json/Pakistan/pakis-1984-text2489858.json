It is not a question as to whether they will join the top global ranks but more when they will do so.\"\n\nConstruction of Karachi unit 2 started in 2015 and is scheduled for commercial operation in 2020, said the company.\n\nAccording to CNNC, the country's self-developed third-generation nuclear power technology adopts a double containment design, with the outer containment providing protection for the primary containment.\n\nThe outer containment dome is a 366-metric-ton multi-surface shell made up of 63 prescribed components.\n\nUnit 5 of CNNC's Fuqing nuclear power plant, the nation's first demonstration nuclear power project using Hualong One technology, has recently succeeded in inverse power transmission, laying a solid foundation for future fuel loading, power generation and transmission for the unit.\n\nChina has charted plans to raise its total installed nuclear capacity to 58 gigawatts by 2020, while it also aims to have another 30 gigawatts under construction by the end of 2020.\n\nzhengxin@chinadaily.com.cn", "subject_codes": ",gdip,gcat,gpir,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "CDGLED", "industry_codes": ",i5020044,i1610109,i1,i16,i16101,i502,iconst,icre,ieutil,iutil,", "modification_datetime": 1560906089000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585474280693, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,karch,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1560902400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",oblrve,chinuc,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
