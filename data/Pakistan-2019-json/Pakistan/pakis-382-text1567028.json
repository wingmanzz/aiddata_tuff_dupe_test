Stage-I will contribute more than 12 billion units per annum to the National Grid. The stage-II will also provide another 9 billion units to the system every year.\n\nThe World Bank is partially providing funds for construction of the stage-I of Dasu Hydropower Project to the tune of US $588.4 million and Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) of US $460 million. The remaining funds are being arranged by Wapda from its own resources and with the sovereign guarantee of the government of Pakistan.", "subject_codes": ",c332,c33,c184,c333,c18,cactio,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "NINTPK", "industry_codes": ",i326,i1610107,i1,i16,i16101,i163,i32,ieutil,iindstrls,iutil,i8396,ibcs,", "modification_datetime": 1574774079000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585474701852, "region_codes": ",pakis,china,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1574726400000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",gnelc,wapda,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
