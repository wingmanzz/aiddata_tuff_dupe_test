The first phase of the project primarily focused on the road infrastructure and the establishment of power plants. This phase has almost reached its fruition, apart from a few road infrastructure projects that need to be completed on fast track basis. The second phase in fact is the most critical as it envisages promotion of industrial and socio economic development in Pakistan with the operationalization of special economic zones. During talks with the Chinese leadership,\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan expressed the commitment to give special emphasis to the SEZs and as the CPEC Authority has been established, we are confident that pace on these industrial clusters will be expedited which will take the country towards boosting the industrial and manufacturing growth, and generate immense job opportunities for our youth. One important project that is facing prolonged delay is the upgradation of main rail line from Peshawar and Karachi. As the JCC is meeting next month in Islamabad, all the modalities should be worked out and hurdles be removed in the execution of this one of the most important connectivity projects that will put Pakistan Railways on modern line. The process of consultations on the CPEC at different levels must continue with much more vigour and speed to reap its benefits as envisioned by the leadership of both Pakistan and China. We must understand that the speedy implementation of the CPEC-related projects will also help foil the designs of those elements that harbour nefarious designs against it.", "subject_codes": ",gvexe,gpol,gcat,gpir,gvbod,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPKOB", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1570782166000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585486392247, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1570752000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",oblrve,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
