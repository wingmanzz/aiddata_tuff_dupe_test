'In the next 3-5 years, if we get this one right, this puts us in a supra-regional play.'\n\nThe bank is looking to leverage its relationship with Chinese companies in Pakistan. It has expanded business with one such company in the United Arab Emirates and is discussing a project in Oman as well, said Aurangzeb.\n\nThe bank's shares have gained almost 20pc this year, while the benchmark KSE-100 Index has dropped about 1pc.\n\nHabib Bank advanced credit and also acquired stake in the nation's first-ever coal mining venture, one of the main Belt and Road projects, with Chinese companies in Pakistan's Thar desert. It has also participated in a few coal-fired power plants and an electricity transmission line project in different roles, Aurangzeb said.\n\nIn its attempt to follow Chinese investment it became the first Pakistani lender to open a branch in Gwadar, a small fishing town where China is developing a port. It also became the first foreign bank to have a branch in Urumqi in western China last year, and acquired a licence last week that allows them to open yuan-based accounts for customers.", "subject_codes": ",c11,c13,ccat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASPTOD", "industry_codes": ",i814,i81402,i81502,i8150206,ibnk,ifinal,iinv,", "modification_datetime": 1573705739000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585482519352, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,easiaz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1573516800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",oblrve,habbnk,akfed,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
