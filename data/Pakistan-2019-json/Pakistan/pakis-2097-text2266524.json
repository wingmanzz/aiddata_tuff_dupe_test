But with its size being scaled back, this estimate has fallen to just 1,500 direct jobs.\n\nMoreover, the government will now set up a services industry in the Islamabad SEZ despite initial plans of developing steel production units, food processing plans, pharmaceutical manufacturing factories, printing and packaging industries.\n\nCPEC Project Director and spokesperson Hasan Daud Butt told Daily Express that they have been working on the SEZ since 2016 but the foundation for the project is expected to be laid later this year. Further, he stated that they were still reviewing a number of recommendations regarding the project as he maintained that the SEZ would create as many as 50,000 employment opportunities.", "subject_codes": "", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "ASETRI", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1549539668000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585463890675, "region_codes": ",pakis,islama,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1549497600000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
