But over the past few months, it started toeing the Chinese line.\n\n* Experts say it illustrates the power of Chinese money.\n\nPakistan, China's largest economic ally in the Muslim world, abruptly stopped censuring Beijing over its unprecedented crackdown on Muslims.\n\nThe shift clearly illustrates the power of Chinese money, activists and critics say.\n\nChina is facing international pressure over its treatment of the Uighurs, a majority-Muslim ethnic minority who live mainly in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.\n\nActivists accuse Chinese authorities of imprisoning up to 1 million Uighurs in prison-like camps, where detainees are reportedly forced to sing hymns to President Xi Jinping and renounce their religion.\n\nBeijing justifies these measures as counterterrorism, and routinely calls the camps \"free vocational training,\" meant to turn Uighurs into \"normal persons.\"\n\nAfter an initial period of silence, Muslim nations have started to speak out about the treatment, which has been condemned by the UN and the US, as well as by dozens of human rights groups.\n\nRead more: A wall of silence around China's oppression of its Muslim minority is starting to crumble\n\nBut Pakistan \u2014 where Islam is the state religion and where Muslims make up more than 90% of the population \u2014 has increasingly muted its voice on China's human rights record in recent months.\n\nIn September, it was the first country in the Muslim world to censure Beijing over its treatment of the Uighurs.\n\nPakistan's federal minister for religious affairs, Noorul Haq Qadri, said that China's intensive regulation of Uighur activity is fuelling extremism, rather than countering it. Beijing's response was to deny that the criticism even happened.\n\nSince then, Pakistan has dramatically changed its tune.\n\n'The Chinese have been a breath of fresh air for us'\n\nIn December, Pakistan's foreign ministry toed the Chinese line, accusing the media of \"trying to sensationalize\" the Xinjiang issue, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nMohammad Faisal, a spokesman for the ministry, echoed China on the detention camps, saying that some Pakistanis detained in Xinjiang were \"undergoing voluntary training\" instead.\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan this week claimed \"I don't actually know much\" about the situation of Muslims in Xinjiang. He discussed his country's economic partnership with China instead.\n\nPakistan is one of the largest recipients of Chinese aid and infrastructure contracts. Loans and infrastructure contracts have been a lifeline to the Pakistani economy, which faces a growing mountain of national and foreign debt.\n\n\"In this doom and gloom which we inherited, the Chinese have been a breath of fresh air for us,\" Khan told Turkey's TRT World news channel. \"They have been extremely helpful to us ... we have these plans of reviving our economy, [and] China is going to play a huge part.\"\n\nChina is 'buying the silence of Pakistan'\n\nExperts have made an explicit link between Pakistan's increasingly tepid response and its reliance on Chinese investment.\n\nMany Muslim countries have refrained from criticizing China over its treatment of Uighurs in the past, likely to keep Chinese investments coming, or to avoid charges of hypocrisy over their own human rights record.\n\nPakistan is a major part of the Belt and Road Initiative, a major Chinese project that aims to link the country to more than 70 countries via infrastructure.\n\nThe China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \u2014 a massive, $62 billion partnership between the two countries consisting of transport and energy projects \u2014 passes directly through Xinjiang.\n\nSimone van Nieuwenhuizen, a Chinese politics researcher at University of Technology Sydney, told INSIDER: \"From the Pakistani government's perspective, it would be wary of raising concerns about human rights in Xinjiang in case this might jeopardize further negotiations.\n\n\"It's possible that Pakistan has moved towards tacit endorsement of China's 're-education' facilities in Xinjiang because it considers the Chinese Communist Party's justification of its Xinjiang policy \u2014 in terms of counter-terrorism and stability maintenance \u2014 as being beneficial to the security and longevity of the CPEC project,\" she added.\n\nPeter Irwin, a project manager at the World Uyghur Congress in Munich, said China was \"buying the silence of Pakistan.\"\n\nHe told INSIDER: \"Khan's statement this week was incredibly worrying, but very much expected.\n\n\"Khan is trying to stabilize the Pakistani economy and he knows that with unreliable American support under Trump, China remains the much more appealing choice \u2014 he knows he simply needs to keep his mouth shut.\"\n\n\"Someone like Khan has a very good idea of the balance of power in their relationship with China,\" he said.\n\n* Read more on the Uighurs:\n\n* A wall of silence around China's oppression of its Muslim minority is starting to crumble\n\n* US clothing company cuts ties with Chinese factory that reportedly used forced labor to make college sportswear\n\n* China is locking up its Muslim minorities, and pushing Islamophobia to get Europe to do it too\n\nNOW WATCH: Inside the Coast Guard's 8-week boot camp where recruits go through extreme physical tests and brutal 'smoke sessions'\n\nSee Also:\n\n* Trump's plan to get out of Syria is collapsing already\n\n* Inside Kim Jong Un's personal train \u2014 which is bulletproof, has all-white conference rooms, and its own red carpet ramp\n\n* Kim Jong Un rode his personal armored train to China to spend his 35th birthday with Xi Jinping\n\nSEE ALSO: A wall of silence around China's oppression of its Muslim minority is starting to crumble", "subject_codes": ",gethm,ghum,gislam,grel,gcat,gcom,gsoc,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "BIZINS", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1547373692000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585465283055, "region_codes": ",china,pakis,easiaz,beijin,xinji,apacz,asiaz,bric,chinaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1547371800000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": "", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
