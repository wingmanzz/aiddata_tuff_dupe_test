'We expect to see little improvement in Pakistan's net exports \u2026 a global slowdown will likely weigh on exports over the coming months,' it said.\n\n'Our view is for global growth to slow from 3.2 percent in 2018 to 2.9 percent by 2020, with growth in two of the largest main export destinations, the US and China, slowing to 2.0 percent and 6 .1 percent respectively by 2020, from 2.9 percent and 6.6 percent in 2018.'\n\nMoreover, imports could increase over the coming months acting as a slight drag on growth and the impact of rising oil prices on imports will be exacerbated by a weakening currency.\n\nFitch said investment, which accounts for approximately 17 percent of the GDP,\n\nwill slow in growth to 5.1 percent in FY19/20, 'as tighter monetary policy implemented by the SBP will likely weigh on investment'.\n\nSince the start of the current fiscal year, the SBP has increased its policy rate by 575bps, to 12.25 percent in May from 6 .5 percent in the beginning of July 2018. 'Moreover, the government has committed to borrow less from the SBP as part of the IMF deal, which will improve the monetary policy transmission in the country,' it said.\n\nHowever, Fitch said investment related to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a centrepiece of China's Belt and Road Initiative, will likely provide some support to the economy over the coming quarters.\n\n'Construction of many key CPEC projects have already started and will stretch over the coming years. In addition, there are more projects in the pipeline that are still at the planning stage but will likely commence soon,' it added.\n\n'We believe that the CPEC will continue to make progress given China's continued push on project implementation and the improving bilateral relations hip between the two countries.'", "subject_codes": ",e212,c341,e1101,e11,c13,ccat,e21,ecat,ncat,nfact,nfcpin,", "company_codes_association_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_lineage": "", "source_code": "NINTPK", "industry_codes": "", "modification_datetime": 1561728558000, "currency_codes": "", "modification_date": 1585481732449, "region_codes": ",pakis,asiaz,devgcoz,dvpcoz,indsubz,sasiaz,", "company_codes_lineage_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_ticker_exchange": "", "credit": "", "publication_datetime": 1561680000000, "company_codes_about_ticker_exchange": "", "company_codes_about": ",imonf,sbpak,", "action": "add", "dateline": null}
