Title: Chinese-funded water project to help ease water shortage in Quetta, Pakistan

Snippet: The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan has handed over a sustainable water project to Pakistans southwest provincial capital Quetta as part of Chinas ongoing efforts to build more social development projects in the country.

Minister Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy Zhao Lijian on Sunday inaugurated the project of five ready-to-use solar-powered tube wells and gave it to Quettas Water and Sanitation Authority (WASA), the sole water distributor in the provincial capital of the southwest Balochistan province.

Body: 
Managing Director of WASA Mujeeb Ur Rehman Qambrani told Xinhua here that Quetta, with a population of 2.5 million people, is undergoing drinking water issues owing to rapid urbanization, increasing population growth and alarming underground water depletion.

During the handover ceremony, Zhao said the project is a gift from the Chinese Embassy for the people of Quetta, adding that several projects like the tube well program have already been started in different parts of Balochistan, especially in southwest Gwadar city.

Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistans Parliament Qasim Suri said that his hometown Quetta has been suffering from water shortage for the last several years. He appreciated Chinas quick response on the Pakistani sides request and established the tube wells.

A local businessman, Haji Jalil, told Xinhua that they had to spend a big portion of their incomes to buy water, but now he hoped that they would be able to save their money to spend on other needs.
