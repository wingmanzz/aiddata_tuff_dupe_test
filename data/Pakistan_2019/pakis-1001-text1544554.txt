Title: CPEC helps advance Pakistan economic growth

Snippet: The Pakistan government and people welcome the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has greatly improved local infrastructure and social welfare, a Chinese official said Monday.

The CPEC is a landmark project for China-Pakistan cooperation in the new era and an important pilot project for China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a press conference.

During the past five years, the corridor has developed 22 projects, created tens of thousands of jobs for local communities and met the electricity needs of 8.6 million households, Geng said.

Less than 20 percent of funds in the projects came from loans from China while more than 80 percent came in the form of Chinese direct investment or non-reimbursable assistance, Geng said, noting that the corridor project helps drive local economic growth rather than impose more burdens.
