Title: Global banks compete to secure contract to structure Pakistan's sovereign bonds

Snippet: The bidders include bank from Europe, the US, China and Gulf countries

Raising these funds are crucial for Pakistan to maintain stable foreign exchange reserves

Body: 
The government received financial and technical bids from top global banks for securing a contract to structure Pakistan's upcoming dollar-dominated sovereign bonds, local media reported citing Ministry of Finance. The government expects to raise between USD 1-2bn through the issuance of Eurobond and Sukuk bonds in order to repay the USD 1bn Sukuk loan taken in 2014 which will mature by the end of Nov. In total, ten bidders submitted offers, including JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Citibank and the Bank of China.

It is crucial for Pakistan to raise funds to ensure that its foreign exchange reserves remain stable ahead of the loan repayment, which currently stands at USD 7.7bn as of Oct 4. The response that Pakistan will receive from floating the sovereign bonds in the global capital market, the first after signing loan agreement with the IMF, will unveil the global investors' confidence in the PTI-led government's structural economic reforms.
