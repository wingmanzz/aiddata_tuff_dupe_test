Title: NAVTTC, Chinese firms to boost Pak workforce in CPEC projects

Snippet: Chinese companies engaged in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in collaboration with the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTCC) will develop a joint mechanism to absorb thousands of skilled Pakistani workers in CPEC projects.

This was stated by the Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing, during a meeting with the NAVTTC chairman and executive director at the NAVTTC headquarters on Thursday. 'To enhance further collaboration with NAVTTC, CPEC Companies Association will present a draft of the Memorandum of Understanding in the near future,' the ambassador said.

'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor plan was living proof of the friendship between Pakistan and China and the entire region would benefit from it, said NAVTTC Chairman Syed Javed Hassan. Investment in youth is the only path towards economic development, he added.

He further stated that presently we are producing only 400,000 skilled people each year and we are committed to increasing the number up to 1 million during the next 18 months.

ED Dr Nasir Khan gave a briefing to the ambassador about the initiatives of NAVTTC for successful implementation of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) reform agendas.

'Right now our priority areas include ensuring meaningful involvement of industry, delivering equal access (skills for all), producing a skilled labour workforce to meet international job requirements, and building a positive image of TVET to attract more youth towards the skill sector,' Dr Nasir said.
