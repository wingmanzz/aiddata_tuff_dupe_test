Title: Orange Line Metro System: Delays cost Rs11 bn to national exchequer

Snippet: Delay in construction of Orange Line Metro System has escalated the premium cost of the project by 50 percent.

The suspension of development work on this mega project has cost Rs11 billion to the national exchequer, officials in Punjab Mass Transit Authority reveal. The estimated premium cost of the project was Rs22 billion but it has increased to Rs30 billion. An additional Rs3 billion has been allocated for the construction of footpaths for this project adding the total premium cost to Rs33 billion.

Body: 
The Orange Line MetroOrange Line Metro System has two components - CPEC component and local component. The first component of Orange Line is part of the CPEC project whereas the second part is to be funded by the Punjab government. The estimated cost of first component, which includes the civil and E and M works is unchanged i.e. $1,458,141,720 ($1.458 billion). The entire funding for CPEC component has been provided by the Chinese government. However, the estimated premium cost of local component, which has to be funded by the government of Punjab has been escalated from Rs22 billion to Rs33 billion.

In order to cut the project's expenditure, the sitting Punjab government has slashed some components of the project but even then the cost has escalated by 50 percent. As per the PC-1 of the project, the Punjab government has to install a 0.4 kilometer long Walkalator from Lahore Railway Station to Metro Bus Station for connecting the two junctions with Orange Line station. However, the PTI government has dropped this from the masterplan. Similarly, a passenger transfer section was to be built between Anarkali and MAO but the present government has slashed this component from the project as well. The project cost would have escalated further if these two section were built as per the original plan.

The Punjab Mass Transit Authority's (PMTA) officials claim the local component price escalation was not because of the delays as the civil works or the E and M were completed in time. The delay in completion of this project was because of court cases, some issues on part of Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) Punjab, Special Protection Unit (SPU) and some other reasons.

According to PMTA authorities, 96.5 percent work on Orange Line Metro Project has been completed and it is on the punch list stage. They cannot give an exact deadline for the inauguration of this project but the Orange Line Metro System is almost complete. It depends on the present government when it decides to complete the remaining part and inaugurate the project.

Cost of Civil Works

As per the PC-1 of Orange Line Metro, the cost of civil works has been estimated $535,641,720 million and the cost of E and M was estimated $922,500,000.

The total estimated price of entire E and M Works of Orange Line Metro System was $973,748,433 however after the negotiation and rebate the estimated price was reduced to $922,500,000.

Per Hour Passenger Capacity

As per the documents, the line is designed with double track with maximum speed of 80 kilometers per hour. For this line the minimum headway is 2 minutes, the design capacity of the system is 30 pairs per hour and design transport capacity is 30,000 persons per hour.

A total of 27 train-sets (135 cars) are to be operated on the Lahore Orange Line Project. Each train-set is composed of 5 cars, including 3 motor cars and 2 trailer cars, with DC 750V current to be collected from bottom of the third rail.

Loan Repayment

At the time of submission of proposal for the Orange Line Metro Project, the Ministry of Planning and Development asked the Punjab government to submit the proposal for loan. The Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) gives approval of any such proposal. However, to get it approved from the ECNEC, the department concerned has to complete all the paper work including the details of the project, source of funding and repayment plans.

To complete the paper work, the Punjab government submitted PC-1 of the project, which include the 20 years repayment plan. The provincial government also presented four options of interest rate to fulfil the documentary requirement for this project. As per the PC-1, the project's total funding requirement comprises 100 percent loan. Per annum repayment of the loan over 20 years at 1 percent, 2 percent, 2.4 percent and 3 percent rate of interest has been determined as $97.46 million, $107.55 million, $111.75 million and 118.21 million per annum.

However, which option of interest rate was finalised between the two state i.e. China and Pakistan is not confirmed. The News contacted the authorities concerned in Punjab government, instead of replying the question the officials said it's a state secret and it cannot be revealed.

When contacted Managing Director Punjab Mass Transit Authority Sibtain Fazal Halim on September 13, 2019, he said Orange Line Metro System case is pending in the court and he cannot talk on this matter. When the MD was told that this correspondent just wants to know the reasons of price escalation of this project, he hung up the phone and did not attend the call again.
