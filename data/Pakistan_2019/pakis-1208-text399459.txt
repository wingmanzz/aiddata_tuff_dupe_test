Title: UAF invites applications for Chinese Language course

Snippet: University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF) has invited applications for Chinese Language course from the interested aspirants. A university spokesman said here on Monday that Pakistan has launched a mega project of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which would be a game changer in the region. The project will also provide millions of jobs to Pakistani youth, however, learning Chinese language was imperative to bridge the communication gap with Chinese engineers, traders and other people. To overcome the difficulty, the UAF has decided to offer short course of Chinese Language for the people as it will enable them to talk and communicate their expressions to Chinese freely. He said that Chinese Confucius Institute UAF would arrange lectures for the students which would be for duration of 3 months.
