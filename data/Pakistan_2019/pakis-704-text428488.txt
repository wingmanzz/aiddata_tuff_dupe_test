Body: 
This piece of writing provides an overview and analysis of Pakistan's and China's Small and Medium Enterprises and a down-to-earth analysis of the One Belt One Road initiative, focusing on how this venture opens up avenues for cross-border Small and Medium Enterprises of the two brotherly countries. This the first time such a detailed analysis of SMEs in China has been done. One important lesson that emerges from this research is that Pakistan's industrialization is possible under CPEC.
