Title: FDI falls 3.1 percent to $542.1 million in July-Sept

Snippet: Foreign direct investment (FDI) marginally dropped 3.1 percent year-on-year to $542.1 million in the first quarter of the current fiscal year as there was a downward trend in inflows from top sourcing destinations, the central bank's data showed on Thursday.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data showed that foreign direct investment amounted to $559.4 million in the corresponding period a year earlier.

Body: 
Net FDI inflows from the country's major investor China showed a major decline to $103 million in the three months period compared with $336.6 million during the corresponding period a year earlier.

Chinese-funded early harvest projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor framework have almost come to an end and that reflected in decline in inflows. The second-stage industrial development is likely to revive investments in the times ahead.

In July-September, net FDI inflows from the US and the UK also fell to $22.5 million and $44.9 million from $19 million and $75.7 million, respectively.

The SBP's data showed that sector-wise the country received the biggest foreign direct investment in communications sector with $255.1 million in the first quarter. Investment outflow of $91.5 million outweighed inflow of $44.4 million in the corresponding period a year earlier.

The second major net FDI was in electrical machinery ($64.8 million), followed by oil and explorations ($34.1 million), hydropower ($27.3 million) and financial business ($24.9 million).

In July-September, total net inflow of foreign private investment registered 51 percent growth owing to substantial increase in portfolio investment during the period.
