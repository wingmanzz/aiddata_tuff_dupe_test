Title: FC deadlines extended for three Pakistani IPPs

Snippet: Pakistan's Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) agreed yesterday (19 February) to extend the financial close deadlines for three power projects with a combined total capacity of 1,784MW, according to meeting notes reviewed by IJGlobal.

The 122nd PPIB meeting - presided by federal power minister Omar Ayub Khan - decided to extend the deadlines for two coal-fired projects and one hydropower project to 2020.

Body: 
The three projects are:

* $2.5 billion, 1,124MW Kohala hydro in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ&K)

* $500 million, 330MW Thar (Siddiqsons Energy) coal-fired at Thar Block-II in Sindh

* $500 million, 330MW Thar (Thar Energy) coal-fired at Thar Block-II in Sindh

Kohala hydro

PPIB vaguely indicated that the reason for Kohala's delay was that “it is the largest hydropower project and so far the single largest investment in any IPP in Pakistan/AJ&K” and directed the “government of AJ&K and PPIB to expeditiously resolve all pending issues of this project on priority basis”.

Special purpose vehicle Kohala Hydro is the sponsor of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project on the Jehlum River. China Three Gorges South Asia Investment - an investment arm of China Three Gorges - owns a majority stake in the SPV.

Shareholders of China Three Gorges South Asia Investment are:

* China Three Gorges - 70%

* IFC - 15%

* Silk Road Fund - 15%

The EPC contract was awarded in January 2017 to a JV between:

* Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development

* China Three Gorges Project Development

Advisers to Kohala Hydro include:

* China Development Bank - mandated lead arranger

* Sinosure - insurance

* SMEC, Lahmayer and three Chinese design institutes - feasibility study

PPIB has issued a letter of support for the BOOT project, which has a tariff of $0.0785 per kWh approved by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).

The anticipated commercial operation date (COD) is June 2026.

Thar coal-fired projects

Meanwhile, the reason for the 12-month extension granted to the two Thar Block-II projects was “to facilitate indigenous fuel based projects”, according to the PPIB.

Originally, the Thar projects were to import coal to power the plants. However, the national government banned in 2016 IPPs based on imported fuel sources, meaning negotiations to source the local Thar lignite coal supplied by Sindh Engro Coal Mining have pushed back financial close.

Siddiqsons Energy - in collaboration with Engro Energy and Arif Habib Equity - is a sponsor of one of the 330MW Thar coal-fired power projects. Siddiqsons Group owns a majority of the SPV, while Engro acquired an additional stake in the project last year (2018).

Harbin Electric was awarded the EPC contract in February 2016.

Though it's not a CPEC project, a letter of commitment has been issued. The COD for this project remains March 2022.

The other 330MW coal-fired under construction is sponsored by Thar Energy. Shareholders in Thar Energy are:

* Hub Power - 60%

* Fauji Fertilizer (FFCL) - 30%

* China Machinery and Engineering Corporation (CMEC) TEL Power Investments - 10%

Thar Energy signed in December (2018) a $262 million financing agreement.

Advisers on the financing were:

* China Development Bank - lead arranger (foreign financing)

* Habib Bank - lead arranger (local financing)

CMEC was awarded the EPC contract.

The planned COD of this CPEC project continues to be March 2021.

PPIB's decision to extend the financial close deadlines for the three projects follows news late last year (2018) that Pakistan's Ministry of Energy had extended the deadlines of two CPEC projects:

* $1.66 billion Matiari-Lahore transmission line

* $542 million Gwadar coal-fired power plant
