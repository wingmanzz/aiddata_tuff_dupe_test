Title: The learning of Chinese language to bring youth better employment opportunities, observes VC-SU

Snippet: Learning a foreign language, any language, will always be a valuable investment of time and effort. Language-learning automatically stimulates the mind, helps you gain multi-tasking skills, and can even boost your intelligence. Besides having intellectual benefits, learning a new language can also be a gateway into a new culture, and allow for a better understanding of peoples and their customs. This has become truer of Chinese language in Pakistan after CPEC has assumed vital importance in the South Asian region. This was stated by VCSU Prof. Dr. Fateh Mohammad Burfat while he cited a newspaper reading on the given theme on the occasion of inaugural ceremony of 3-month Chinese language course at ASEAN Conference Hall of the Area Study Centre Fareast and Southeast Asia, University of Sindh, Jamshoro sponsored by Confucius Institute.
