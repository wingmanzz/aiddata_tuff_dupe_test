In his first exclusive interaction with The News after assuming charge of Minister of Planning, Development, Reforms and Special Initiatives, Asad Umar said that the Planning Commission had decided to grant approval of PC-1 of ML-1 after completion of detailed engineering design of the project. Now the detailed engineering design was completed, the government decided to hire international consultant with the mandate to gauge the capacity of operating modernized railway after making huge investments.

He said the cost of modernising railway under ML-1 already went up by $1 billion from $8.2 billion to $9.2 billion so firm up at planning stage would help to execute this huge project.

To another query regarding execution of ML-1 when the country was under the IMF programme, Asad Umar replied that the debt sustainability was ensured for execution of ML-1 project as the purpose of making flaw free plan was to convert this project commercially viable.

The consultant, he said, would take four to five months to scrutinize ML-1 project in totality. After doing this spadework the PC-1 of ML-1 will be approved by different relevant forums, he added.

Meanwhile, the sources said that China indicated to execute this project in EPC mode as they were not ready to undertake this project on BOT (Built-Operate and Transfer) basis.
