Title: CPEC the foremost priority

Snippet: CPEC is the foremost priority of the government. The government decision about the CPEC that there will be one Authority which will resolve all the problems and queries relating to CPEC. The decision came a day after the visit of PM Khan to China, during which he met the Chinese President, Prime Minister and business community. Among the subjects discussed during the trip, CPEC figured out prominently. CPEC, costing around $64B, is a development project which aims to connect Gwadar port in south-western Pakistan to China's Xinjiang region. The project is widely perceived as game changer not only for Pakistan's economy, but also to the Central Asia, South Asia and the Middle East regions and beyond.

Body: 
Due to the significance of the project and the challenges to this project PM Khan decided to frame a single Authority, to be headquartered at the PMO, to look after the mega project. This shows the seriousness of the government and the guarantee to the investors for their investment in this project. It's a good sign of developing the trust as well as interest of the investors. PM Khan's decision was warmly welcomed by the business community and Pakistani society and was highly appreciated by the social media.
