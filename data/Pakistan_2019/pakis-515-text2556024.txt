Mohmand Dam

The groundbreaking of the project was to be held today (January 2) but was postponed owing to pressing engagements of the prime minister.

Mohammad Dam is the flood control dam and after its construction it will be able to store 300,000 cusecs of water. The cost of the said project in 2003 stood at $1 billion which has now swelled to $3 billion because of the inordinate delay during Musharraf regime.
