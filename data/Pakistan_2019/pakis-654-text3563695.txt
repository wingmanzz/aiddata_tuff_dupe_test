Yao Jing said the FTA between Pakistan and China would be singed on April 28 besides other important agreements related to CPEC during visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan.

He assured that the employment in the SEZs would be taken from the local resources and latest technology would be transferred from China to Pakistan.

He informed that cooperation under industrial and social sectors would be the main focus of second phase of CPEC.

'There are six areas under social sector including education, health, agriculture, water, irrigation, and poverty alleviation in which around 26 new projects will be initiated in Pakistan,' he said.
