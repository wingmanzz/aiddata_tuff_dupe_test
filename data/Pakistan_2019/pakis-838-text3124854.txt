Title: Adoption of Chinese model stressed

Snippet: Pakistan's tax system should be revamped in line with Chinese taxation model, which is based on growth instead of the regulatory pressures, said Pakistan-China Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCJCCI) President Shah Faisal Afridi. While presiding over a high level meeting with the executive committee of the chamber, Afridi was of the view that administrative reforms were essential in tax mechanism and attention should be paid on re-designing of tax recovery system. He further gave a briefing on the proposed tax reforms roadmap based on the Chinese taxation framework. The PCJCCI president stressed the need to create an optimal balance between a tax regime and the growth of business to create an investment friendly environment along with an effective mechanism for leveraging enough revenue for public service.
