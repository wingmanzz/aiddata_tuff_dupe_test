WASHINGTON/POLITICS

--------------------------------

TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT _ Talks between President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un collapse after the two sides failed to bridge a standoff over U.S. sanctions on the reclusive nation, a dispiriting end to high-stakes meetings meant to disarm a global threat. SENT: 1400 words, photos, video, audio. WITH: TRUMP-KIM-SUMMIT-KIM'S GAMBLE-ANALYSIS _ Despite failure to find common ground with Trump, Kim isn't going home empty-handed. SENT: 890 words, photos.

TRUMP-LAWYER INVESTIGATION-CONGRESS _ In a damning depiction of Donald Trump, the president's former lawyer cast him as a racist and a con man who used his inner circle to cover up politically damaging allegations about sex and who lied throughout the 2016 election campaign about his business interests in Russia. SENT: 1500 words, photos, video. UPCOMING: Developing from 9:30 a.m. Cohen appearance at closed House intelligence panel, 1000 words by 4 p.m., photos, video. WITH: TRUMP-LAWYER INVESTIGATION-RACE _ From the start of Michael Cohen's congressional testimony, President Trump's views on race took center stage.

--------------

COYOTE FUR _ Those fur-trimmed parkas so common on city sidewalks have become a boon to backwoods trappers. Coyote fur pelts are in big demand to provide the lush, silvery or tawny-tinged arcs of fur on the hoods on Canada Goose coats and their many global imitators. A good western coyote, prized for its silky, light-colored fur, can fetch more than $100. The top price at a recent Colorado auction hit $170, a 40 percent increase from four years ago. SENT: 675 words, photos.

WESTERN STORMS _ Floodwaters that turned two Northern California communities into islands were expected to begin receding Thursday as a rain-engorged river finally peaked after swamping thousands of homes, businesses and other buildings. SENT: 700 words, photos.

INTERNATIONAL

----------------------

PAKISTAN-INDIA _ Pakistan's prime minister pledged his country would release a captured Indian jetfighter pilot the following day, a move that could help defuse the most-serious confrontation in two decades between the nuclear-armed neighbors over the disputed region of Kashmir. Prime Minister Imran Khan made the announcement in an address to both houses of Parliament, saying he tried to reach his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Wednesday with a message that he wants to de-escalate tensions. SENT: 1,050 words, photos.

ISRAEL-NETANYAHU _ Israel's attorney general is expected to deliver a much-anticipated decision on whether to indict Benjamin Netanyahu on a series of corruption allegations, a momentous move that looks to shake up Israel's election campaign and potentially spell the end of the prime minister's illustrious political career. SENT: 820 words, photos.

--------------------------

BUSINESS/ECONOMY

--------------------------

ECONOMY-GDP _ The U.S. economy slowed in the final three months of last year to an annual growth rate of 2.6 percent, the slowest pace since the beginning of 2018, as various factors including the government shutdown took a toll on growth. Economists believe growth has slowed even more in the current quarter. SENT: 630 words.

HUAWEI-SECURITY THREAT _ Security experts say the U.S. government is likely exaggerating the threat it says the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei poses to the world's next-generation wireless networks. Washington has mounted an intense diplomatic offensive that paints Huawei as a servant of Beijing's intelligence agencies. Critics say the U.S. case is short on specifics and glosses over the fact that China doesn't need secret access to Huawei routers to infiltrate global networks. SENT: 1,200 words, photos.

ENTERTAINMENT

----------------------

STAR WARS-GALAXY’S EDGE _ A behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming “Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge,” the largest single-themed land created at Disney parks. It will open in California in the summer and Florida in the fall. By Entertainment Writer Jonathan Landrum Jr. SENT: 960 words, photos.

SPORTS

----------------------

HEAT-WADE’S WINNER _ It's been more than nine years, and Dwyane Wade still wonders from time to time how Kobe Bryant hit a straightaway 3-pointer off the glass to beat him. Finally, he has his answer. Down by two, at home, last possession. That was the scenario when Bryant made his 3-pointer over Wade on Dec. 4, 2009 to give the Los Angeles Lakers a one-point win over the Miami Heat. And that was the scenario Wednesday, when Wade did it against the Golden State Warriors. SENT: 485 words, photos.
