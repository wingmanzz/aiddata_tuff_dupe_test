Title: SAPM: (Transmission of FM-98 Dosti Channel to be expanded from Gwadar to GB: Dr Firdous)

Snippet: Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting, Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan has said that transmission of FM-98 Dosti Channel will be expanded from Gwadar to Gilgit-Baltistan.

Addressing a ceremony in connection with 70th anniversary of Republic of China organized by the FM-98 Dosti Channel in Islamabad, she invited the Chinese government to open more such channels in five major cities of the country so it should be audible to all along the China-Pak Economic Corridor route.

Body: 
She said China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has become the hallmark of these fraternal relations. She said friendly relations between Pakistan and China really remained loftier than the Himalaya, deeper than oceans, and sweeter than honey.

She said the leaderships of both the countries always strived to further consolidate these relations and achieve reciprocal benefits.

About Kashmir, Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan said China has overwhelmingly supported Pakistan's stance over recent oppressive measures taken by the New Delhi in violation of fundamental rights of the people of occupied Kashmir.

She said these actions were also taken while trampling down all international laws, UN Charter, principles of the partition of united India, and the Indian constitution itself.

On the occasion, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing said the cordial relations between the two countries entered into new era after the launch of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project.
