Title: 'One Belt Road Initiative' to be a symbol of Pak-China friendship: Qureshi

Snippet: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi Thursday said that One Belt and Road Initiative will eventually become a sign of Pakistan-China friendship.

He said it will be an icon for bilateral friendship since both countries were charting new frontiers. The minister in a tweet said: 'The Great Wall of China is a symbol of China's triumphs and might. It has stood the test of time, much like the friendship between Pakistan and China." He said "As we chart new frontiers, the One Belt and Road Initiative will be the new symbol of our united triumphs and perseverance." He shared a picture of his autograph that says, 'Long live Pakistan-China friendship, the only iron brothers in the world." In China, Pakistan has a unique name of Batie, which means 'iron brother'.
