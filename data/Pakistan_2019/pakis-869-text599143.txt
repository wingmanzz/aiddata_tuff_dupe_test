Body: 
He said that he would soon visit China and meet its leadership to strengthen the friendship between the two countries.

It has been learnt that most of the CPEC-related projects have been stalled for a while due to certain reasons, including prevailing financial crunch confronting the government and "non-cooperation" of the bureaucracy due to "fear of the National Accountability Bureau", Dawn news reported.

Minister for Planning and Development Khusro Bakhtiar has apprised the meeting about CPEC-related projects and the progress so far made on it.

Railway Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed briefed the meeting on Main Line-1 (ML-1) projects being executed to lay a new railway track from Karachi to Peshawar under the umbrella of the CPEC.

Prime Minister Imran Khan said that the government’s plan to introduce uniform curriculum in the country would be implemented by March next year so that all graduates could have equal opportunities to grow in their practical life while addressing a prize distribution ceremony for madrassah students who had performed distinctively in the examinations of contemporary education boards and seminaries.

“The graduates of the new education system will have an understanding of religion, contemporary knowledge and science and technology”, he added.
