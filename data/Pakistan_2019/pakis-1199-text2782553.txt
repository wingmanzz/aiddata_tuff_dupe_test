Title: Pak unveils China-funded train

Snippet: Lahore, Dec. 11 -- Pakistan on Tuesday inaugurated the trial run of its first mass transit project, which is funded by China.

The Orange Line Metro train, which would complete 27km of distance in 45 minutes, will pass through the congested areas of Lahore where more than 250,000 passengers travel on a daily basis.

Body: 
Punjab transport minister Muhammad Jehanzaib Khan inaugurated the trial run. After the successful completion of the testing phase, the project is expected to open doors for the general public by March 2020.

In 2014, China signed an MoU with Pakistan to fund the Lahore Metro Rail project.

China's Exim Bank agreed to provide a soft loan of around $1,500 million.

Opposition PML-N celebrated the opening of the project saying it is a gift to the Lahorites from the Sharif brothers.

PML-N Punjab spokesperson Azma Bokhari has termed it a wise decision of chief minister Usman Buzdar not to formally inaugurate the metro train, saying the credit goes to former chief minister Shahbaz Sharif.

Started in 2015, the project was to be completed before the July 2018 elections but was delayed because of a stay order issued by the supreme court.
