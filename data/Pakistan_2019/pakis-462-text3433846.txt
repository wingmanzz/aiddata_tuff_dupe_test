Title: Pakistan launches crackdown on Chinese traffickers

Snippet: Islamabad (dpa) - Pakistan has arrested dozens of Chinese men and their agents in a crackdown this week against traffickers targeting young women, officials said on Thursday.

The arrests were made in various cities of the central province of Punjab since Sunday, said Saeed Abbasi from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).

Body: 
Half a dozen women between the ages of 17 and 25 were rescued during the operation.

The swoop was launched after several, mostly Christian, Pakistani women were lured by the prospect of marriage with Chinese men, trafficked to China and forced to become prostitutes there.

Most of the women were rescued by Chinese authorities after the Pakistani embassy in Beijing alerted officials about the trafficking, Abbasi added.   

"Chinese gangs have been working in a very organized way," said FIA's Tariq Rustam Chohan, who was leading the action in the eastern city of Lahore.

Chohan said at least 30 Chinese and more than a dozen of their local agents had been arrested from Lahore alone.
