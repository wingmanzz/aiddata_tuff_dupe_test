Snippet: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday was informed that Chinese and Russian companies were taking a keen interest in the restoration of Pakistan Steel Mills.

Speaking on the occasion, PM Imran said that the government would provide all possible facilities to investors so as to ensure 'ease of doing business' in the country.
