Body: 
Shah Faisal Afridi was confident that Pakistan could attract Chinese manufacturing sector by developing trained workforce for industries. He termed this phenomenon as a great industrial transfer, which could produce plenty of opportunities for Pakistan.

Mr. Shah Faisal Afridi proposed that China should assist Pakistan in empowering its labor force in line with its industrial requirements by formulating collaborative Research institutes and capacity building organizations that would impart vocational training to Pakistani labor as per Chinese work ethics including language and communication. China can help to establish such training institutes in Pakistan that would keep themselves in touch with the ongoing Chinese industrial trends, he said adding that the proposed institutes would be empowered enough to have machines.
