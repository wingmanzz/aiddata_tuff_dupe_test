Title: CPEC feeding 300MW of wind energy to national grid

Snippet: The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has contributed 300MW of clean wind energy to the national grid through its four early harvest wind power projects.

According to sources from embassy of China in Pakistan, the four wind projects that had been completed under CPEC and are connected with the national grid include Dawood wind power project (50 MW), Sachal Energy wind farm (50MW), three Gorges second wind farm project (100MW), and UEP wind farm project (100MW).

The total investment amount is $224 million on the basis of Build-Own-Operate (BOO), with a construction period of 18 months and an operation period of 20 years.

The total installation capacity is100MW, with an annual electricity output of 286.6 GWH. It was listed as an actively promoted project in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor in August 2014.

Pakistan Jhimpir UEP 100MW wind farm is located in Jhimpir, Thatta district, Sindh, 110km from Karachi.

The total installed capacity is 100MW with the supply of 66 sets of wind turbine generators (WTGs) of 1.5MW per set. It also includes construction of a 132KV substation and a control centre.

This is a foreign direct investment (FDI) project and is developed by UEP Wind Power (Pvt.) Limited, a joint venture of Orient Group Investment Holdings Co, Ltd. (99%) and United Energy Group Co., Ltd. (1%). China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC) is the engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) contractor.
