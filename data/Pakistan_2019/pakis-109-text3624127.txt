Title: Balochistan has potential to meet energy needs: Alyani

Snippet: Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani has said that Balochistan has great potential to meet energy requirements of the country by using alternative sources.

Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of 1,320MW coal-fired power plant at Gadani on Monday, the chief minister said the installation of a big power plant jointly by China and Hubco was an achievement towards speedy development and welfare of people of the province.

Body: 
Prime Minister Imran Khan inaugurated the power plant.

Mr Alyani welcomed the Chinese investors and offered assistance in fisheries, mines, minerals and other sectors.

'An economic zone is being established in Lasbela to facilitate foreign investors in Balochistan,' he said.

The power project is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which will meet the increasing demand of electricity in the country.

'Unfortunately, Balochistan had not been given importance in the mega project of CPEC earlier, but now under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan all our grievances and complaints will be removed,' he said.
