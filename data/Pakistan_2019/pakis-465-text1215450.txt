Air Chief Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan, Chief of the Air Staff, Pakistan Air Force was the chief guest of the roll-out ceremony said, JF-17 overhaul is indeed a significant achievement, which could not have been achieved without the dedication and hard work put in by the officers and technicians of Aircraft Rebuild Factory."

He also appreciated the continuous support of Chinese Aviation Industries including the top management of Chinese partners in the JF-17 program such as AVIC, CATIC, CAIC and CADI.

The capability to locally overhaul the JF-17 will give Pakistan the ability to keep its JF-17 fleet at an increased level of readiness.

The JF-17 is to transition to its Block III model next year incorporating major changes to its radar, avionics, communications and weapons.
