He said that Pakistan Railways was already undertaking the mega project of Main Line-I (ML-I) which was 1872 kilometres long upgradtion of Karachi - Peshawar train route.

The project, being executed as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), would bring economic revolution not only in Pakistan Railways but also in the country, he added.

Giving details of the project, he said the development of ML-I would include fencing on both sides, repair of bridges and laying of new track from Peshawar to Karachi.

"The project will remove all the unmanned level crossing on the railway network of ML-I which will also control trains' accidents," the minister added.
