Title: Significance of CPEC

Snippet: This is with reference to the negative propaganda against CPEC project that intrusion of Chinese products into the Pakistani market may cause unemployment and destruction of local manufacturing industries. In reality, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project is vital for both Pakistan and China. This mega project will also improve the regional connectivity and will transform the region into the economic hub. This project will change the destiny of all the countries in the region. CPEC will bring an economic revolution in our country and will help the people improve their life standard.

Body: 
The Middle East and European countries are also expressing their interest to be the part of this game changer project. Pakistan defence forces have taken the responsibility of security of CPEC and will leave no space for enemies to sabotage this project. Furthermore, the government had established the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority (CPECA). The basic aim of forming the Authority is to ensure timely completion of the CPEC projects.'

The Prime Minister has said the CPECA will help ensure coordination among the departments concerned. Putting aside all the conspiracy theories and how the CPEC is bound to destroy local industry in Pakistan. Merely taking a notice of these theories is a sheer waste of one's time. While in actuality CPEC is bound to improve the life of locals, especially in regions far less developed and under-developed.
