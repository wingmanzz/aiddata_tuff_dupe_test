Snippet: A coal power plant of 300 megawatts under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) framework came online in Balochistan on Monday as the $60 billion worth of Chinese-funded projects entered the second stage of agriculture cooperation and industrial development.

Minister for Planning, Development and Reform Khusro Bakhtyar and National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) Vice Chairman Ning Jizhe inaugurated the 300 MW coal power plant during their visit to Gwadar, an official statement said. Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani, senior officials and Chinese delegation members were present during the inauguration ceremony.

CPEC projects started six years back with most of them related to power production that was envisaged to add more than 10,000 MW to the grid.

The letter of interest for the 300 MW coal-fired power project was issued in 2017 and the project was initially estimated to cost more than Rs50 billion. CIHC Pak Power Company Limited is the developer of the project based on imported coal.
