Bureaucracy Today sources learnt that Yao said that that the second phase of the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA) will be finalised in October after which 90 per cent of Pakistani exports including agricultural products and seafood will attract a zero per cent duty.

"Market access will increase Pakistan's exports by USD 500 million, which will reduce the disparity between bilateral trade," said Yao.
