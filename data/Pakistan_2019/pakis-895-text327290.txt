Title: July FDI down 59 percent YoY

Snippet: The inflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the country remained sluggish in the first month of this fiscal year (FY20). According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Pakistan attracted FDI amounting to $ 73.4 million in July 2019 compared to $ 179 million in July 2018, showing a decline of 59 percent or $105.6 million. During the period under review, FDI inflows stood at $ 168.4 million against the outflow of $ 95.1 million.

Even Chinese investment in Pakistan stood negative during July 2019. The SBP statistics revealed that with $ 18.4 million inflows and $ 22.9 million outflow, Chinese investment in Pakistan stood negative $ 45 million during the first month of this fiscal year.
