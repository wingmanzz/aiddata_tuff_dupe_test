JUVENILE TERROR LOOPHOLE _ The Justice Department’s ability to charge minors for supporting terrorist groups has been hampered by a 2018 Supreme Court decision. The ruling has forced federal prosecutors to hand off at least one such case to local authorities. The decision in a case unrelated to terrorism opened a loophole that could allow young supporters of groups like the Islamic State to skate on charges from the federal government. By Jake Bleiberg and Michael Balsamo. SENT: 680 words, photo.

PAKISTAN-CHINA-TRAFFICKING-BRIDES _ Muqadas Ashraf was just 16 when her parents married her off to a Chinese man who had come to Pakistan looking for a bride. Less than five months later, Muqadas is back in her home country, pregnant and seeking a divorce from a husband she says was abusive. She is one of hundreds of poor Christian girls who have been trafficked to China in a market for brides that has swiftly grown in Pakistan since late last year, activists say. Brokers are aggressively seeking out girls for Chinese men, sometimes even cruising outside churches to ask for potential brides. They are being helped by Christian clerics paid to target impoverished parents in their congregation with promises of wealth in exchange for their daughters. By Kathy Gannon and Dake Kang.

TV-COURT TV REBOOT _ Court TV is ending its long recess. The channel that thrived during the trial-crazy 1990s comes back from the dead after more than a decade amid true-crime craze that its backers hope will launch it into a long new life. The new Court TV, which will be available over the air and on some cable providers, will focus on big cases such as the upcoming sexual assault trial of Harvey Weinstein. But it will also focus on little-known trials that were essential to the old network. By Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton. SENT: 990 words, photos.

CHAPEL-ON-THE-RIVER _ Among the gum and cypress trees of a southeastern Louisiana swamp, where Spanish moss hangs from the branches and bald eagles and osprey fly overhead, sits a little chapel called Our Lady of Blind River _ the legacy of one woman's faith. The one-room chapel was built decades ago after Martha Deroche says she had a vision of Jesus kneeling by a rock, and over the years it became a spiritual haven for passing boaters, kayakers, hunters and fishermen who ply the placid waters of the river. Time and the elements have damaged the structure and Martha and her husband have passed away, but a new generation of the family is determined to preserve it for future travelers to again enjoy a tranquil place for prayer.
