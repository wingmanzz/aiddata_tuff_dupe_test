Title: China to give $2.5bn loan to forex-dry Pak

Snippet: In a bid to help Pakistan overcome its financial crisis, China has agreed to provide $2.5 billion in loans to boost the country's insufficient foreign exchange reserves."Beijing will place the $2.5 billion in deposits with the central bank," a Pakistan government official was quoted by media as saying on Saturday. The deposits will surge Beijing's contribution to Pakistan in this fiscal to $4.5 billion. Last year, China had deposited $2 billion with the State Bank of Pakistan.

Given Pakistan's critical economic condition, one of the first things that Imran Khan did after becoming PM was to visit China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE to arrange loans.
