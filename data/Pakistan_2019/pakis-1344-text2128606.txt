Title: 'China economic slowdown will not hurt CPEC'

Snippet: The Pakistan Economy Watch (PEW) on Sunday said global economic problems, Chinese economic slowdown, and Pakistan's internal problems will not hurt China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Pakistan is facing a shortage of foreign exchange, running a large deficit, and other problems which will not hit the pace of progress on the economic corridor, said Dr. Murtaza Mughal, President of PEW. He said that the European economy is weakening since 2017, the Japanese economy is also going down while global GDP has taken a blow by the trade war initiated by the US president. The US trade ware will keep the global GDP down for a few years while some nations will still be able to ensure their growth. Dr. Murtaza Mughal said that the Chinese economy is on the lowest since the last three decades but its growth rate is still double the expansion in the GDP of Europe.

 He said that the Chinese economic slowdown is serious which has worried many countries but it has enough reserves to keep critical projects on track.
