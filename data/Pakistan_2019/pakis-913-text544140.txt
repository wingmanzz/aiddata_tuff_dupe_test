Title: 'Youth will carry Sino-Pak relationship forward'

Snippet: Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing said on Tuesday that Sino-Pak friendship and cooperation is the most important flag of Chinese diplomacy and neighbourhood policy.

Addressing an awards ceremony for students who participated in poetry, essay and skit/dialogue competitions at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts, Mr Yao said Sino-Pak friendship is based on people-to-people contact and is therefore 'unshakeable'.

Body: 
Cultural performances by students were also featured at the ceremony, including tableaus highlighting cultural heritage and ties between China and Pakistan.

Mr Yao said Pakistan is moving towards a positive force for regional and international peace and development, with a bright future. He said Sino-Pak friendship also has a bright future, as both countries are celebrating seven decades of friendship, and the youth will now carry this relationship forward.

The ceremony was organised by the All Pakistan China Friendship Association in collaboration with the China Cultural Centre to commemorate 70 years of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and to award Pakistani students who participated in various events.

Mr Yao awarded certificates and prizes to winning students.
