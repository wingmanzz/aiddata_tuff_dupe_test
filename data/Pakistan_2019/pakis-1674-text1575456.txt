Title: Launching Dasu power project

Snippet: Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) has signed Rs.52 billion contract with a joint venture of General Electric Hydro China and Power China Zhongnan Engineering Corporation for electro-mechanical work of Dasu Hydropower Project stage-1. It includes design, supply and installation of France made turbines, generators, main transformers, switch gears and related equipment. The electrical heavy equipment of western companies is popular for efficiency, reliability and longer life.

World Bank is the major financier of this project to be completed with cost of Rs.510 billion. Phase-1 shall be completed by 2024, adding 2160 megawatt electricity to the national grid. After the completion of stage-2 the power generation potential will be then go up to 4320 megawatt.

Body: 
At present the electricity generation installed capacity is more than the actual peak demand. But the faulty transmission and distribution system is not picking the additional electricity generated from thermal and hydel sources. In summer the system overloading and imbalances often cause tripping and power breakdowns. The rag tag transmission system needs modernization for which the Asian Development Bank had approved a concessionary loan of $ 4.f billion in 2016. Moreover, China had agreed to provide finances for laying high voltage Mitiari-Lahore transmission line. Hopefully, up-gradation of power transmission will get due attention in decision making.
