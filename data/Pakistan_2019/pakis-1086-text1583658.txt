Title: Pakistan Autos Report - Q3 2019

Snippet: We believe that Pakistan's automotive sector will start to struggle in (FY) 2018/19 (July 2018 to June 2019) and FY2019/20, as the risks that we highlighted in 2018, namely the over-reliance of the sector on Chinese investment, come to fruition. A slowdown in Chinese investment will have a more significant impact on heavy commercial vehicles. Passenger vehicle sales will fare better as the removal of non-income tax-filers' vehicle purchasing restrictions provide some relief. Due to the slowing investment, and by extension weakening consumer sentiment, we have moved to revise down our forecast for new vehicle sales in FY2018/19 and FY2019/20 to a 2.4% contraction and 1.3% growth respectively.
