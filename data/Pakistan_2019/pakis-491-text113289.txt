Its retracement zone at $1306.30 to $1300.40 is the primary downside target.

The dollar, which is at a more than one-week high, was on course for a fourth straight session of gains for gold

Fundamentals

Gold moved slightly higher, supported by uncertainties surrounding U.S-China trade relations ahead of President Donald Trump's State of the Union address to the Congress, while a firmer dollar and rising global stock markets capped gains.

Spot gold edged up 0.2 percent to $1,314.66 per ounce after hitting its weakest since Jan. 29 at $1,308.20 in the previous session. U.S gold futures settled unchanged at $1,319.20 an ounce.

Gold last week rose to its highest since late April at $1,326.30, after the U.S central bank kept interest rates steady and said it would be patient on further hikes amid a cloudy outlook for the economy due to global growth concerns and the U.S-China trade dispute.

Gold can often take cues from moves in the dollar, with a stronger currency making commodities priced in the unit more expensive to users of other currencies.

A key driver to the gold sector is its need to stay relevant to investors from both active funds and the increasingly important passive funds. Gold tends to fall out of favor when interest rates rise.

There are still political concerns which remain and that probably adds to support for gold, along with the dovish U.S Federal Reserve. Solid U.S jobs data has allayed concerns of an immediate slowdown in the U.S. economy.

Higher bond yields can also pressure gold and other commodities that offer no yield but in yesterday dealings, the 10-year Treasury note yield was down 2.2 basis points at 2.701%.
