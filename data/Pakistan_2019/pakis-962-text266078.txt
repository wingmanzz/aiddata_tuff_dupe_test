Title: Pak-China FTA to become operational shortly: Ambassador Hashmi

Snippet: Pakistan's Ambassador to China Naghmana Alamgir Hashmi says the Free Trade Agreement signed between Pakistan and China would become operational in a few months.

In an exclusive interview to 'China Economic Net' in Beijing on Friday, she said the agreement is still going through the internal processes of being ratified.

Body: 
Naghmana Hashmi said on Pakistan's side, all the procedures have been completed while on the Chinese side, there are a few procedures which are left.

Commenting on increase in Pakistan's exports to China, she said with the FTA becoming operational, the prices will go down, because the import duties will not apply then.

The Ambassador said the second phase of CPEC has been started, which is actually the establishment of special economic zones in various parts of the country.

She reiterated that all CPEC projects have absolute and full support of the government, people and all political parties of Pakistan.
