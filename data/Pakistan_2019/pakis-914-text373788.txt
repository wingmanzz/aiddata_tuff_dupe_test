Title: Pakistan considers developing coal-to-liquids plant in Thar

Snippet: Pakistan is discussing with the Shenhua Ningxia Coal Industry Group (part of the Chinese coal giant Shenhua Group) to develop a coal-to-liquids (CTL) plant in the Thar region of the Sindh province. The company has already developed a CTL project in the northwestern Chinese region of Ningxia, which can produce 4 Mt/year of coal-derived diesel.

Shenhua Group had already expressed its interest in tapping the large coal resources of the Thar field and planned to develop two 350 MW coal-fired power plants in the region; the projects were cancelled after the Pakistan's previous government decided to revise downward the already decided tariff rates for the power generation.

Body: 
Thar coal reserves are estimated at 185 Gt. Pakistan plans to reach 20 GW of coal-fired power capacity by 2030 under its "Vision 2030" programme. Rising oil demand would also justify the development of CTL.
