Title: Pakistan Freight Transport & Shipping Report - 2019

Snippet: The Pakistani freight sector will witness modest yet stable growth in 2019 and over the five years to 2023 driven by a confluence of factors. Steady economic expansion, rising levels of domestic demand and robust investments will all support an uptick in the national freight and logistics sector. In addition to uptick in trade volumes, the country will further benefit from healthy relations with China, predominantly in the form of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project that will underpin a robust capital intensive infrastructure investment regimen.
