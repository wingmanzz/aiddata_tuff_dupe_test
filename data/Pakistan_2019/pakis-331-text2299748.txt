She said China is a long-standing and deep friend to Pakistan and it has always supported us in every hour of need. Dr. Firdous Ashiq Awan said Pak-China friendship has assumed a proverbial status and it is sweeter than honey, higher than Himalaya and deeper than oceans.

The Special Assistant said economic zones to be established under CPEC will generate job opportunities for people. She said the commercial loans taken from China will witness remarkable reduction in the months and years to come.
