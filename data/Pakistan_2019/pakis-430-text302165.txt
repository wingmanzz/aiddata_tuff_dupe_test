Recently, the two parties were in end stages of finalizing and signing the Concession Agreement, following which the Ground Breaking of the project will take place. Though, the concession agreement has been finalized but, according to sources, the utility services to the zone were yet to be provided. A request for 209 MW was made to NTDC and PESCO while request for 30 MMCFD was also made to SNGPL.

However, according to sources, other SEZs are yet to attract Chinese companies and investors for lack of facilities and progress on required services. Earlier Pakistan had requested China for cooperating in developing at least one SEZ.

As per the documents, even allocation of land was yet to be made for ICT Model Industrial Zone, Islamabad. Though Capital Development Authority (CDA) has identified three sites in G-11 sector measuring an area of 3-5 acres on the request of Board of Investment (BoI) but the authority has informed that the sites were to allotted only for offices and not for establishment of SEZ.

Apart from allocation of land to SEZs, according to sources, the key issues for these zones were provision of requisite infrastructure, power, gas, and security. According to the documents three SEZs including Rashakai, Dhabheji and Allama Iqbal industrial city were needed 740 megawatt electricity and at least 170 MMCFD gas to be operational. It does not include other priority zones under CPEC.

Earlier Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) had also observed that provision of utilities i.e. electricity and gas, was responsibility of the federal government. Without gas and electricity no SEZ can be developed. The ECC had directed power and petroleum divisions to prepare plans for uninterrupted electricity and gas supplies to the SEZs in consultation with the provincial governments. The expenditure on provision of utilities like grid stations shall be met through PSDP. The ECC also observed that the provincial governments are required to speed up work on the establishment of SEZs and provision of requisite infrastructure for establishment of industry.
