Pakistan Autos Q2 2019

Body: 
Key View:

We believe that Pakistan's automotive sector will start to struggle in FY2018 (July 2018 to June 2019) and FY2019, as therisks that we highlighted in 2018, namely the over-reliance of the sector on Chinese investment, come to fruition. A slowdown inChinese investment will have a more significant impact on heavy commercial vehicles. Passenger vehicle sales will fare better as theremoval of non-income tax-filers' vehicle purchasing restrictions provide some relief. Due to the slowing investment, and byextension weakening consumer sentiment, we have revised down our forecast for new vehicle sales in FY2018 and FY2019 to a2.4% contraction and 1.3% growth respectively.
