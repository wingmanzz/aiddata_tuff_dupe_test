and China under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The CPEC, he added, was the dynamic portfolio of various projects with the investment started from $ 46 billion and now reached up to $ 59 billion with the addition of new projects.

China-Pakistan Economic Corridor was basically a framework of regional connectivity that would not only benefit the countries of China and Pakistan but also have positive impacts on Iran, Afghanistan, India, Central Asian Republics and the overall region, he maintained.

The mega project was going to provide us with the enhancement of geographical linkages having improved road, rail and air transportation system with frequent and free exchanges of services, he mentioned and underlined the need for people to people contact for enhancing understanding through academic, cultural and regional knowledge.

Afridi noted that a number of special measures had been taken by PCJCCI to fill in the gap in people to people communication, for which as a first step strong efforts had been made to overcome language barrier. He informed that our move to promote Chinese language in Pakistan was being reciprocated by the Chinese people to promote Urdu language in China. In this context, exchange of students between the two countries is also playing a vital role.
