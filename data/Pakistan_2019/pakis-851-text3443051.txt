Title: PM Imran to offer Pakistan Steel Mills to China

Snippet: Prime Minister Imran Khan has decided to hand over Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) to China for its revival through government to government deal and exploring options to finance multi-billion-dollar railways Mainline (ML-1) during his upcoming visit of Beijing. Pakistan's top leadership will give assurances to the Chinese side that China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would not slow down, but its next phase would be pursued with zeal and vigour despite passing through under the IMF programme.

According to his upcoming scheduled visit of China on October 7, the prime minister has decided to take up five issues for enhancing economic cooperation under CPEC. Pakistan will offer China to get Pakistan Steel Mills, finalise deal on modernisation of ML-1, financing of Bunji hydropower project, agriculture and social sectors related projects in and outside the ambit of CPEC. 'Yes, the government will seek assistance for construction of Bunji dam,' top official sources told The News.
