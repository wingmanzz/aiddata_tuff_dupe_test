Title: Ahsan Iqbal clarifies loan from China under CPEC is $5.8 billion contradicts Asad Umar's figure

Snippet: ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) senior politician Ahsan Iqbal on Sunday revealed that the total loan volume granted by China for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was USD 5.8 billion and not USD 18 billion.

The veteran politician took to his official Twitter handle to correct the figures mentioned by newly appointed Minister for Planning Asad Umar, and pointed out that the amount "[is] payable in 20-25 years with the average markup of 2%." He further claimed that the terms under which the loan has been granted could not be called as "loan" but "a special gift for iron brother Pakistan from China".
