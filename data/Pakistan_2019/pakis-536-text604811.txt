Title: Pakistan Railways

Snippet: As stated by Federal Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid Ahmed Pakistan that China has finalized the multi-billion dollar Main Line-I (ML-I) project as part of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The finalized project is worth $8.2 billion. He shared feasibility report of ML-2 (Fast Train) project with his Chinese counterpart and said that 'We are planning to start work on the fast train project soon after the completion of ML-I in the next 3-4 years,' He said the length of railway track from Karachi to Peshawar will be around 1,800 kilometers and the new signalling system will be installed. There will not be any crossing on the new track and all the existing railway crossings will be abolished after completion of ML-I project.

Body: 
The Minister is requested to first plug the corruption rampant in Railways that has shattered the whole system and tarnished the image of this institution in the eyes of citizens. It is unbelievable that that an ailing person can win a marathon race. First, we need to set things right in railways. There is a serious problem of over staffing, low efficiency, red-tapism, etc. Many scams of ghost pensioners have surfaced time and again. It would be in the fitness of things if we first set our house right and then go for mega projects. The available facilities of railways have been denied to majority of masses of this country.
