Snippet: The total energy sector circular debt has reached Rs 1,362 billion including Rs 755 billion of Power Holding Company Limited (PHCL) and Rs 607 billion of Standby Term Finance Facility (STFF) loans.

This was stated by Secretary Power Division, Irfan Ali, while briefing the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) which met here under the chairmanship of Mian Shehbaz Sharif. The secretary while giving the details of the circular debt said that increase in circular debt is due to power theft, line losses, outdated power transmission lines and non-recovery of power bills both within the public sector entities and private consumers.

Giving the details of the sector-wise demand-based payables of circular debt as on 30.11-2018, he said Rs 36.2 billion are payable to Gencos (based on gas/RLNG/O&M), Rs 83.5 billion to oil based Gencos, Rs 450.5 billion to IPPs (CPP+EPP), Rs 28.6 billion to nuclear and Rs 156.7 billion to NTDC/WAPDA.

Sharif said that the Gencos are a mafia with having around 25% efficiency and producing per unit of electricity at Rs 28, adding that Gencos must not be used for power production.

On a question regarding the tariff of LNG-based power plants, he said that Nepra in 2015 approved 10.5 cents per unit tariff for the LNG based powers plants but when the plants started power production, due to better efficiency and latest technology used in the plants, the power tariff was 6.5 cents per unit.

He said that with the assistance of Asian Development Bank, the government is to launch AMI meters project in Lahore Electricity Supply Company and Islamabad Electricity Supply Company premises at a cost $40 million. He said that in the first phase the AMI meters will be installed in the areas with high power theft cases and in the second phase the project will be launched in Peshawar Electricity Supply Company, Multan Electricity Supply Company, Hyderabad Electricity Supply Company and other areas with high power theft cases. He said that the second phase of the AMI metering will cost $500 million.
