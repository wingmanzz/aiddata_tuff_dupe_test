Title: China gifts goods worth $200,000 to Gwadar fishermen

Snippet: In view of the problems being faced by the fishermen of Gwadar, China has gifted to them fishing equipment and machinery worth $200,000.

Engines of fishing boats, small solar systems and latest fishing nets were included in the goods that were handed over by Chinese Consul General in Karachi Wang Yu to the chairman of the Gwadar Fishermen Alliance, Khudadad Wajo, on Wednesday.

Body: 
'The Chinese government will provide more aid to Balochistan, including Gwadar, under the socio-economic development phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which will address the issues that common people are facing,' Mr Wang said on the occasion.

He said the strategic ties between Pakistan and China have been on an upward trajectory since the launch of CPEC, which would also address the economic backwardness of Balochistan. The people would get opportunities to enjoy the fruits of economic development, he said and added that natural resources and promising sectors would be explored and efforts made to promote the strategic location of the province.
