Title: Seeking foreign investment in minerals

Snippet: Addressing CPEC and Khyber Pukhtunkhwa conference at the University of Peshawar, Governor Shah Farman said that foreign investors had remained shy of investment in the rich mineral reserves of the province. He expressed the hope that Chinese companies will come forward in exploiting these reserves.

Previous provincial government had announced mineral development policy in 2016 for both settled and tribal districts, envisaging liberal incentives for investors but favourable response from foreign is yet to come. In November last year KP minister had signed MoU in China for setting up minerals processing industry in Rashakai special economic zone.

Body: 
The tribal districts have vast reserves of exotic minerals but primitive mining technology is being applied which results in big waste of minerals. There are also complaints of illegal mining. Foreign investment in mining of minerals will minimise the losses that are accrued due to application of crude technology and processing with latest technology will fetch them high price by virtue of value addition.
