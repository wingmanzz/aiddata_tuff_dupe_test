China was witnessing economic renewal at massive scale by following the European model of relocating a part of its manufacturing sector to the economically viable places bearing skilled labour at low wages, he said.

Afridi was confident that Pakistan could attract Chinese manufacturing sector by developing trained workforce for industries. He termed this phenomenon a great industrial transfer, which could produce plenty of opportunities for Pakistan.
