In his remarks, the Executive Director termed the award of scholarships a good opportunity for the scholars to not only acquire education but also to learn Chinese culture and traditions. He advised the students not to limit the scope of their education to a degree and expand their canvas to learning about the vast spectrum of engineering, covering logistics, infrastructure, and impact. He said transportation engineering has become a destiny of all nations, as it plays a pivotal role in development of countries.

Shedding light on the evolution of transportation sector over the years, he said the high-speed railway track transportation system of China has shrunk the distances and taught the world a lesson about importance of time. "Go with an aim to learn from China as to how the Chinese manage time, work as a team, and come up with masterpieces" he emphasised.

Lt. Gen. (R) Asghar extended gratitude to Chines government and CRBC for provision of education opportunities to Pakistani scholars. He said about 25,000 Pakistani students are currently studying in China and the number is likely to grow. HEC will continue supporting the Chinese Embassy and companies like CRBC in creating study opportunities for Pakistani youth, he asserted.

He said CRBC is one of the state-owned companies in China which earliest entered the project contracting market in Pakistan. He added that the company mainly participated in the highway projects in Sindh and successively completed 4A project in Sindh and Sukkur Bypass Project. He also highlighted the role of CRBC in Raikot-Khunjerab Section Project. Till now, he informed, the CRBC has completed the improvement and realignment of Karakoram Highway at Attabad Lake Project.
