Title: Alice Wells concerns about CPEC incorrect: Asad Umar

Snippet: Newly appointed Minister for Planning, Asad Umar, said on Saturday that United States Assistant Secretary Alice Wells' concerns about China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) are incorrect. Addressing a press conference along with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Khurram Sher Zaman in the coastal city, Asad Umar said that the first phase of the CPEC is now complete in which investment was focused on infrastructure. He informed the members of the press that Pakistan has $4. 9 billion loans only because of CPEC. He said that the biggest challenge for the incumbent government was loans.

Body: 
'Deficit will reduce further within three to four years, ' the former Finance Minister said, adding that Pakistan's relations with China are not a threat to anyone. 'CPEC remains our first priority, ' Asad Umar declared. 'China is progressing very quickly in the field of technology, and we will benefit from it. China has always stood by Pakistan in its difficult times, ' the minister said. 'We want investment from Europe and the United States. Our relations with friendly countries will not become lax. '
