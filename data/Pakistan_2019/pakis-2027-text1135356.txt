Title: RIM PETROCHEMICALS NO.2931 PET and RAW MATERIALS Purified Terephthalic Acid / Monoethylene Glycol

Snippet: Prices for purified terephthalic acid (PTA) on a bonded warehouse basis were in the range of $670-690/mt on Tuesday, steady from the previous day. China domestic prices fell in line with a decline in PTA futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. Under the circumstances, spot cargos were talked at Yuan 5,200-5,210 and CFR China cargoes were discussed at around $650/mt.

Prices for ethylene glycol (EG) on a CFR China basis strengthened to $565-575/mt on Tuesday, up $10/mt from the previous day. China domestic prices increased by Yuan 65/mt to Yuan $4,830-4,910/mt. Both CFR China and China domestic prices firmed since inventories were drawing down. In addition, there would be limited volumes of imported cargoes to arrive in China this week, which also buoyed the prices. CFR China cargoes were discussed at $565-575 while cargoes in the Chinese domestic market were talked at Yuan 4,830-4,910/mt.
