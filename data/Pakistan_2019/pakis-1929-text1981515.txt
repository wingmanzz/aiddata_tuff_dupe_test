Title: Ahsan Iqbal clarifies loan from China under CPEC is $5.8 billion; contradicts Asad Umar's figure

Snippet: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Secretary General and former planning minister Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhry on Sunday revealed that the total loan volume granted by China for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was USD 5.8 billion and not USD 18 billion.

The veteran politician took to his official Twitter handle to correct the figures mentioned by newly appointed Minister for Planning Asad Umar, and pointed out that the amount '[is] payable in 20-25 years with the average markup of 2%.'

He further claimed that the terms under which the loan has been granted could not be called as 'loan' but 'a special gift for iron brother Pakistan from China'. 'All energy projects are in IPP mode,' he said.

Earlier, Asad Umar had stated that the interest rate on the '$18 billion loan from China was only 2 percent.'
