Abu Dhabi Media announced a partnership with Sogou, the Chinese search engine and technology giant, to develop the world's first Arabic speaking news anchor.

According to the UAE official news agency WAM, the virtual 'News Anchor' will be the first Arabic-speaking in the world with the ability to interact through face expressions with the Arabic language.

The announcement was made during a special signing ceremony at Abu Dhabi Media (ADM) headquarters in the presence of UAE Minister of Artificial Intelligence Omar Sultan Al Olama. Director General of the ADM, Dr Ali Bin Tamim and General Manager of Voice Interaction Technology Centre of Sogou, Wang Yanfeng signed the agreement.
