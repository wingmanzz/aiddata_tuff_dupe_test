Title: CPEC projects: China complains about red-tapism, delays

Official sources said that during the meeting Pakistani side was pushing Chinese for the early inauguration of Sukkur-Multan Motorway, Rashakai Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and Gwadar International airport. The National Highway Authority officials have asked the representative of the Chinese company that they want the inauguration of Sukkur Multan Motorway within next few days, said the source. However, Chinese side was of the view that they have their machinery on the site and it is not possible for them to do the inauguration within next couple of days as demanded by NHA, said the source. However, later Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms asked both the sides to sit together and resolve the issue, said the source. Similarly, the issue of the ground breaking of Rashakai SEZ was also discussed and the Chinese have complained that neither water nor electricity were provided to the site, therefore it cannot be inaugurated without the provision of basic amenities. The Chinese side was also upset over the delay in issuing of exemption to the import of machinery by FBR which is causing delay in projects.
