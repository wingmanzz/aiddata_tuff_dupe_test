JUVENILE TERROR LOOPHOLE _ The Justice Department’s ability to charge minors for supporting terrorist groups has been hampered by a 2018 Supreme Court decision. The ruling has forced federal prosecutors to hand off at least one such case to local authorities. The decision in a case unrelated to terrorism opened a loophole that could allow young supporters of groups like the Islamic State to skate on charges from the federal government. By Jake Bleiberg and Michael Balsamo. SENT: 680 words, photo.

PAKISTAN-CHINA-TRAFFICKING-BRIDES _ Muqadas Ashraf was just 16 when her parents married her off to a Chinese man who had come to Pakistan looking for a bride. Less than five months later, Muqadas is back in her home country, pregnant and seeking a divorce from a husband she says was abusive. She is one of hundreds of poor Christian girls who have been trafficked to China in a market for brides that has swiftly grown in Pakistan since late last year, activists say. Brokers are aggressively seeking out girls for Chinese men, sometimes even cruising outside churches to ask for potential brides. They are being helped by Christian clerics paid to target impoverished parents in their congregation with promises of wealth in exchange for their daughters. By Kathy Gannon and Dake Kang. SENT: 1,900 words, photos. An abridged version of 970 words has also been sent.

But it will also focus on little-known trials that were essential to the old network. By Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton. SENT: 990 words, photos.
