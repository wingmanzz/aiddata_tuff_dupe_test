The minister said 1000 acres of land had been acquired for the economic zone wherein 702 acres would be for industrial units and the remaining for the residential accommodation and other required facilities.

The Chinese company would fund the project and the provincial government would be the owner of the land, he maintained.

Denying the reports of Rs7 billion corruption in the BRT, he said legal notices would be sent to those carrying the news.

He repeated the claim that the BRT was the most transparent project and nobody can prove a single penny corruption in it.

In cases related to terrorism, only 12 percent were punished last year and 88 percent were acquitted.

Assuring the lawmakers of ensuring their privilege the minister warned that strict action would be taken against police officers found misbehaving with the elected public representative.
