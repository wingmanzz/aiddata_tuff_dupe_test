Title: Pakistan power company eyes $50m rights issue

Snippet: Pakistan’s Hub Power Co (Hubco) has launched a rights issue to fund an increase of its stake in the local subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned power company.

Hubco is looking to raise proceeds of up to Prp7bn ($49.7m) — selling 139.9m rights shares, or 12.5% of its equity capital, at Prp50 per share, according to a term sheet seen by GlobalCapital Asia.

Body: 
With the capital raised, the issuer plans to boost its position in China Hub Power Generation Co from 26.5% to 47.5%.

China Hub Power operates a coal power plant in Hub, a city in the Balochistan region of Pakistan — in the middle of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative to create a web of international economic partnerships.

China Power is a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based and listed China Power International Development. The latter is a subsidiary of China’s State Power Investment Corp.

Issuer Hubco is an independent Pakistan-based power company. It runs a series of power plants and is involved in various power projects.
