Title: Pakistan won't abandon all-weather friends: Sarwar

Snippet: Governor Chaudhry Sarwar has said that Pakistan wants stability in the region and strengthening ties further with China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

'They are all-weather friends of Pakistan and have always proven to be allies in tough times, and Pakistan will not abandon them in times of need,' he said.

Body: 
The governor said the visit of Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan will provide an impetus to take Pak-China relations to another level and added that a welcome dinner will be hosted in Mr Qishan's honour at Governor House on Monday (today).

Talking to Overseas Pakistanis Commission Vice Chairman Muhammad Waseem and others, the governor said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government's road map to pull the country out of economic crisis would bring progress and prosperity. He said the budget 2019-20 would entirely be people-friendly and provide maximum relief to the common man. He also said the menace of corruption would be eradicated from the country and transparency brought to the state institutions.
