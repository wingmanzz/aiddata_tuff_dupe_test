Pakistan's overall business environment will remain largely the same in the 2019-23 forecast period, with the country getting an overall score of 4.49, compared with 4.50 in 2014-18. Pakistan will retain its last-place ranking of 17th regionally, meaning that it has failed to improve relative to other countries in Asia. Globally, it slips four places to 76th out of 82 countries. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led government's reliance on multiple coalition partners, coupled with an inefficient bureaucracy, will limit political effectiveness. Although the government will have the military's tacit backing, strong challenges from opposition parties and a difficult security situation will continue to add to instability in the political environment.

The government will continue gradually to liberalise rules on foreign investment to try to offset investor concerns about the difficult political and security environment. However, bureaucratic obstacles and foreign-exchange controls will remain in place owing to balance-of-payments strains, impeding foreign trade and capital transfers. Under an IMF programme starting in the latter half of 2019, the government will make efforts to improve the environment for private businesses and competition, but with limited success. Financing investments will remain extremely problematic. Corruption and tax evasion, often abetted by tax-collection officials, will remain widespread. The government will continue to expand ties with China and boost bilateral trade and investment. Energy and transport projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will continue, but infrastructure will remain one of the weaker aspects of the business environment. Levels of internet and mobile-phone penetration will continue improving but remain low by global standards, meaning that Pakistan's technological readiness will remain poor. The country's research-and-development spending will also remain low.
