Title: Pakistan's first CPEC special economic zone PPP signed

Snippet: Pakistan and the concessionaire have signed a PPP agreement on a new special economic zone (SEZ) in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), making it the first SEZ to be developed under the Belt and Road Initiative's China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) framework.

Provincial-government owned Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Economic Zones Development and Management (KPEZDMC) and China Road and Bridge (CRBC) have signed a PPP agreement to develop the new 1,000-acre Rashakai SEZ.

Body: 
CRBC's experience developing KPEZDMC's 424-acre Hattar SEZ helped boost its chances on securing the 30-year BOT Rashakai concession. Meanwhile, Hattar is expanding to become a 1,000-acre SEZ.

KPEZDMC - the developer and manager of industrial estates and SEZs in KP - and CRBC signed the Rashakai SEZ project MoU and engagement agreement in January 2018, while the JV agreement was signed in November 2018.

CRBC will invest $120-128 million, according to local media.

Rashakai's construction is planned in three 2-year phases, with Phase 1's groundbreaking this month (May 2019).

Procurement of power and energy is underway. Project planners estimate the SEZ needs about 210MW capacity and 30 million cubic feet per day of gas. However, agreements with National Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC), Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) have yet to be finalised.

CRBC - a subsidiary of China Communications Construction (CCCC) - will build a 225MW combined cycle gas turbine plant to power the Rashakai SEZ.

Herbert Smith Freehills (HSF) has advised CRBC on the new SEZ. "This was a complex and bespoke project - it's the first industrial zone in the province and will be developed under the laws governing both Pakistan's special economic zone regime and its provincial PPP regime," said HSF partner Ellen Zhang.

A total of nine SEZs covering nearly 10,000 acres in Pakistan are priorities under CPEC:

* Allama Iqbal - 3,000 acres in Punjab

* Bostan - 1,000 acres in Balochistan

* Dhabeji Thatta - 1,000 acres in Sindh

* ICT Model - 200-500 acres in Islamabad Capital Territory

* Mirpur - 1,078 acres in Azad Jammu Kashmir

* Mohmand Marble City - 350 acres in KP

* Moqpondass - 250 acres in Gilgit-Baltistan

* Port Qasim - 1,500 acres in Sindh

* Rashakai - 1,000 acres in KP

While each SEZ is at a different development stage, Dhabeji Thatta is reportedly the furthest along after Rashakai. The feasibility studies, master plan and land acquisition have finished. The market expects the draft concession agreement and request for proposals to be issued this month (May 2019), IJGlobal understands. Bidding on Dhabeji is anticipated to be more open than Rashakai, according to local media.
