The Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the Council will be as follows: (i) to be the interface between business community and government on matters related to CPEC; (ii) to advise working groups on matters relating to CPEC; (iii) to recommend strategies for expediting ongoing and future B2B projects particularly industrial cooperation and development of Gwadar;(iv) to discuss new initiatives and major projects in social sector that support economic development under CPEC); (v) to advise on development an integrated approach on future development of CPEC with special focus on agriculture, industry and tourism; and (vii) to advise on any other issue referred by government of Pakistan.

Talking about socio-economic development cooperation under CPEC programme, the sources said, first meeting of the JWG socio economic development was held on December 19, 2018. Experts' team visited Pakistan from February 24 to March 8, 2019. Pakistan and China have already shared preliminary list of projects. Priority has been given to less developed areas of each province (e.g) Southern Punjab, Northern Sindh, newly merged areas of the KP. Fast track projects will be completed in one year whereas remaining projects will be completed in 2 and 3 years. The MoU on socioeconomic development will be signed during belt and road forum to ensure early implementation of the projects.

Commenting on ML-I project, the sources said, the project is an "early harvest project" under CPEC programme and it was declared strategic by both government in 6th JCC meeting held in December, 2016. Inter-Governmental Framework Agreement (FWA) was signed between the two governments for implementation of the project in May, 2017. The $8.2 billion project was to be implemented in two phases. Phase-I would have 9 priority sub-projects and phase-II would comprise of 7 sub-projects.

The Chinese maintained that the framework agreement needs to be followed and the project needs to be done in the ECP+F mode. Changing to other modes/models like BOT, BOOT etc would delay the project. The preliminary design of the project has been submitted by the design consultants and is being reviewed by the vetting consultants. Once there is consensus on the preliminary design and way forward, supplementary agreement to the framework agreement will be required.

Phases may be taken up concurrently if fiscal space allows and railways operations are not disrupted; (iii) reduce total cost from $8.2 billion to $ 6.08 billion by reducing the space. Karachi-Hyderabad new double line on new alignment to be offered on a BOT mode, Karachi-Hyderabad existing line overhauling deleted, all rolling stock has been deleted (to be procured through international competitive bidding as and when required), Taxila-Havelian section has been dropped and scope of work of a dry port near Havilian reduced in line with traffic forecasts; (iv) extend construction period from 5 to 8 years (or more); and (v) signing a supplementary framework agreement encompassing the changes at belt and road forum.
