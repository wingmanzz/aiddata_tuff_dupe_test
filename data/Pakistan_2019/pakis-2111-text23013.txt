Snippet: Board of Investment (BoI) Chairman Haroon Sharif on Sunday said that Rashakai, Special Economic Zones (SEZs) had a strategic significance as it was closer to Afghanistan and resources rich Central Asian Republics (CARs). Rashakai SEZs was a joint venture between the Chinese company of China Road and Bridge Cooperation (CRBC) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government aiming to provide the facility of ease of doing business in the area, Haroon told APP here. Replying to a question regarding Rashakai Economic Zone, he said recently, a delegation of CRBC, led by Director Shi Xiaobo, had visited BoI to discuss the time lines to make the economic zone operational.

Discussing the importance of Rashakai, Sharif said that the Chinese had termed it as a role model project for other SEZs.

Haroon said the BOI was committed to completing four special economic zones (SEZs) related to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) within six months.
