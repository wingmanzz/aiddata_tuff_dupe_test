Title: Oracle Power Shares Rise on Pakistan-Project Funding Commitment

Snippet: Shares of Oracle Power PLC (ORCP.LN) traded higher Thursday after the company said that a consortium of companies to which it belongs has agreed to provide $2.5 million of pre-development funding for a coal mine and power plant in Pakistan.

The U.K. energy developer said that it, along with Beijing Jingneng Power Co. (600578.SH) and PowerChina International Group Ltd., agreed to provide funding for the project. This follows a memorandum of understanding that the consortium signed in December.

Body: 
Beijing Jingneng Power will hold a 78% stake in the project, and commit a minimum of $1.95 million, while Oracle will hold a 12.1% stake and commit $300,000, the company said. PowerChina will invest $250,000 and have the remaining 9.9% interest.

Oracle said the funds should be sufficient to meet the project's costs until financial close.

Shares of Oracle at 1412 GMT were up 0.13 pence, or 16%, at 0.60 pence.
