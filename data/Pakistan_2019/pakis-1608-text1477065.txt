Title: Balochistan replete with investment opportunities: Governor

Snippet: Balochistan Governor Amanullah Yasinzai has credited the provincial government with creating economic opportunities in the province. 'Balochistan now has abundant economic opportunities and the provincial government is taking all possible measures to uplift economic activities in the province', he said. He also pledged full security for the province's private investors.

Speaking on Monday while meeting with Chinese businesman Roy, who called on him here at the Governor's House, he also termed the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) a mega project that would, upon its completion, help end economic stagnation around the world, especially in Southern and Central Asia, according to a press release issued here.

The governor said macroeconomic and social activities would be boosted by CPEC's completion, adding Balochistan had vast opportunities for investment and the current government had taken several steps to attract foreign investors to the province. He also appreciated Chinese investors who, he said, were taking special interest in investing in Pakistan, especially in Balochistan.

During the meeting, Chinese businessman Roy lauded the decades-long friendly Pak-China relations, adding Chinese investors were willing to invest in Balochistan's Health, Education and Information Technology (IT) sectors.
