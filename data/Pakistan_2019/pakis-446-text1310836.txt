Body: 
The prime minister said that the joint projects under the CPEC are a positive sign, adding that it is recommended that more coal is brought from Thar to be utilised for this power plant.

'There are 6,000 Pakistani engineers working in the project,' said the prime minister.

He further said that electricity is being produced from coal in Thar, adding that due to CPEC the country is progressing.

The prime minister said that Pakistan's biggest issue is corruption which kept people at bay from making any investments.

Imran earlier arrived in Karachi for a day-long visit during which he held important meetings with different political representatives from Sindh.

Members of National Assembly and Sindh Assembly belonging to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Muttahida Qaumi Movement and Grand Democratic Alliance met with the prime minister.
