The minister reiterated that ML-1 was an important project under CPEC portfolio and that the incumbent government was committed to executing it on a fast-track basis.

The meeting decided to present the draft act of the CPEC Authority before the federal cabinet for approval.

On Rashakai Special Economic Zone, the meeting was informed that negotiations on a 'development agreement' with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) were in the final stage.

The committee directed the officials concerned to ensure the provision of utilities to Rashakai SEZ on a priority basis so that the groundbreaking could be performed next month.

The planning minister said that the government was committed to providing incentives to all SEZs, including 100pc repatriation of profits.

The committee also decided to table the 'land use plan' for Gwadar Smart City before the federal cabinet after incorporating recommendations of the Balochistan government.

Energy projects, including 300MW Gwadar Coal Power Plant, 1,124MW Kohala Hydropower Project and Thar coal projects, and infrastructure projects, including Multan-Sukkur Motorway and Orange Line Train project, were also deliberated upon during the meeting.

It was apprised that the Multan-Sukkur Motorway would become operational soon, while civil works on the Orange Line Train Project would be completed by the end of this year.

The planning minister further emphasised that all stakeholders should resolve the pending issues pertaining to CPEC projects at the earliest to accrue maximum benefits from the forthcoming Joint Cooperation Committee meeting.

It was decided that the next meeting of Cabinet Committee on CPEC would be convened in September.
