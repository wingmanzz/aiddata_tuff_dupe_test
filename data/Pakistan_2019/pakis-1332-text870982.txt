Title: Imran Khan to use Belt and Road Forum in Beijing for lobbying

Snippet: BEIJING: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will spend four days in Beijing from April 25 to attend an international forum of discussion on China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of which his country is the biggest beneficiary.He will use the occasion to lobby with visiting foreign leaders for support for Pakistan’s request for a loan from the International Monetary Fund. He will also try to present Islamabad’s case regarding the recent military strife with India.Khan is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang on the sidelines of the Belt and Road Forum, informed sources said. He will also get an opportunity to meet several other foreign leaders because the forum will attract heads of state/government and senior leaders from 37 countries.The absence of India, which is expected to boycott the forum, will also offer an opportunity for unhindered lobbying over the recent cross-border missile exchanges and the Masood Azhar controversy.

Body: 
 But there are limits to which he can present Pakistan’s case.Pakistan is both a showcase for China’s BRI as well as a liability. Beijing can hardly pride itself over the fact that its biggest infrastructure investment is in a country facing turbulent financial conditions and suffered a downgrade in Standard & Poor’s ratings last month.Loans taken by Pakistan from China and Saudi Arabia have made it difficult for Islamabad to obtain an IMF loan. The country’s finance minister, Asad Umar, recently resigned over differences with PM Imran Khan on this issue.Khan, who will be accompanied by a ministerial delegation, is scheduled to deliver a speech at the opening ceremony of the Belt and Road Forum and participate in the Leaders’ Round Table. He will also address a Pakistan trade and investment conference in Beijing.
