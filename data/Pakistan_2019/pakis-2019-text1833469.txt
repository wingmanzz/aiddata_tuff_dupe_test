Speaking on the occasion, Mr Zhuhai congratulated the scholars and stressed the need for promoting people-to-people exchange between China and Pakistan through such initiatives.

He said human resource cooperation between the two countries was vital to enhance bilateral relations. He affirmed that China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would further cement the relations, adding the project had entered a new phase as a large number of Chinese companies were investing in the project.

The HEC ED termed the award of scholarships a good opportunity for the scholars to not only acquire education but also learn Chinese culture and traditions. He advised the students not to limit the scope of their education to a degree and expand their canvas to learning about the vast spectrum of engineering, covering logistics, infrastructure and impact.

'HEC will continue supporting the Chinese Embassy and companies like CRBC in creating study opportunities for Pakistani youth,' he added.
