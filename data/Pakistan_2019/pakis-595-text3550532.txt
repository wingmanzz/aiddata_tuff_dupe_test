The President of the Gwadar Fishermen's Association thanked the Consulate General for his support. The local fishermen, he said are highly obliged for the care and love of the Chinese government and Chinese people for fishermen in Gwadar. He was confident that the East Bay Expressway will highly promote the further development of Gwadar Port.
