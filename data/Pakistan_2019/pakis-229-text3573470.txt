Title: NHPC secures tunnel contract in the border belt

Snippet: The Indian Army has inked a MoU with the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Limited (NHPC) to construct tunnels on the international borders with China and Pakistan. Under the pilot project, three tunnels will be built on the China border and one along the Line of Control with Pakistan. Official sources said that the mega project will bolster the Indian Army's capabilities along the Chinese border where India's infrastructural development is fast outpacing that of its adversaries. Up till now, it was difficult to move heavy machinery and equipment in the mountainous region due to lack of infrastructure development. Besides strengthening the defensive capabilities, the tunnels will protect the ammunition and other stored equipment from air-strikes and detection by enemy satellites.
