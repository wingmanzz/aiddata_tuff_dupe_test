Pakistan is pleased to have the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as centerpiece of the country's economic growth and prosperity, a high-ranking Pakistani military official declared in a speech at the Embassy of Pakistan in Beijing on Tuesday.

Body: 
His words came shortly after the construction of the 392km Sukkur-Multan Motorway under the auspices of the CPEC was completed two weeks ahead of the contract due date on July 23.

The motorway, known as M5 in Pakistan, is a part of the Peshawar-Karachi link and represents the largest transportation infrastructure project under the CPEC.

The CPEC is a trade network of highways, railways, pipelines and optical cables, and a flagship project under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The official said Pakistan embraces and fully supports the BRI, and the CPEC, which encompasses investments in two major areas of energy and infrastructure and has already achieved significant progress.

He said the China-Pakistan relationship is not a transitional, issue-based or interest-driven one; rather, it is a solid friendship based on mutual trust and respect dating back to the era of the ancient Silk Road.

Faced with some common challenges in the 21st Century, Pakistan and China share an identical world view and vision of development, since the two countries both value peace, stability and prosperity, he added.

"China was, is and will remain our friend," the official said, "and we will help each other in times of need."
