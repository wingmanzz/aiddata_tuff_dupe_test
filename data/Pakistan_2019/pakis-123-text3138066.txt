Title: Review facility for players in World Tour

Snippet: History of sorts will be created when for the first time in an International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) event, players will be able to review decisions made by umpires with the support of table tennis review (TTR) in the World Tour Grand Finals being held at Zhengzhou, China, from Dec 12 to 15.

According to an ITTF announcement, with the help of highly accurate ball tracking technology, it will be possible to have a point replayed instantly and reviewed by a video match official who will have the authority to overturn the original decision based on the evidence.

Body: 
It further said TTR will be implemented by Chinese technology firm Rigour Tech, selected by the ITTF, following a tender process in Aug and which has already conducted three successful days of behind-the-scenes tests at the ITTF Men's World Cup between Nov 29 to Dec 1 in Chengdu.

Should the full-scale implementation at the coming event prove successful, the ITTF will be looking to ensure that TTR features at most top tiers events in 2020, it said.
