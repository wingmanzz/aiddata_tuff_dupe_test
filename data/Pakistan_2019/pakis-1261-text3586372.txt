Title: Gov, SPV sign on Pakistan's largest Thar coal-fired

Snippet: The Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) and special purpose vehicle (SPV) of a $1.912 billion coal-fired power plant complex in Sindh, Pakistan have signed on 16 December (2019) the project's implementation agreement.

SPV Thar Coal Block-I Power Generation (TCB-I) is developing the 1.32GW Thar Block-I coal-fired power plant complex.

Body: 
Shanghai Electric Power is the main shareholder of the project company.

PPIB said that the financial close of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, consisting of 2x 660MW supercritical units, “is expected to be achieved very soon”.

TCB-I has already signed the power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee).

TCB-I will source the domestic coal from Sino Sindh Resources (SSRL), owner of the mining lease rights in Thar Block-I lignite mine, which is spread over 150 square kilometres. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is said to have agreed to provide $1 billion debt for the mining operations. Mining work on Thar Coal Block-I began about two months ago (October 2019).

PPIB anticipates that the power complex's first unit will start generating electricity in March 2021, with commercial operations date (COD) by August 2022. The second unit's COD is expected half a year later (February 2023).

The Thar-I power plant will connect with the $1.66 billion, 878km Matiari-Lahore high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line - Pakistan's first HVDC. The transmission line is under construction and should be operating by March 2021. That transaction reached financial close in February (2019).
