Title: FIA arrests eight Chinese men involved in human trafficking

Snippet: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Monday arrested eight Chinese men involved in trafficking Pakistani girls to China and forcing them into prostitution.

The arrests were made during a crackdown launched across Punjab, including Lahore.

Body: 
According to the FIA, these Chinese men were involved in the practice of trafficking Pakistani girls in the guise of marriage, forcing them into prostitution later.

So far, 10 Chinese men have been arrested in the scandal. The suspects arrested on Monday include Wang Hao, Shoi Sheli, Wong Yhazou, Chang Shail Rai, Pan Khowajay, Wang Bao, Zaothi and Kaindisko.

On Thursday, FIA in an intelligence-based operation raided a wedding ceremony in Faisalabad and arrested the Chinese groom who has been identified as Chang.

Insiders revealed that Christian women were subjected to sexual exploitation after being trafficked to the neighbouring country soon after their false marriage.
