Title: China's Fengfan Wins USD16 Million Power Equipment Contract in Pakistan

Snippet: (Yicai Global) July 8 -- Fengfan Power Equipment will provide CNY110 million (USD16 million) worth of tower equipment and supporting facilities for a power transmission project titled ADB-200 in Pakistan, funded by the Asian Development Bank.

China's Electric Power Engineering Consulting Institute, one of the project contractors, and Fengfan Power inked a supply contract, the Changshu-based bidder said in a statement. The pair will determine the schedule later.

Body: 
Shandong's Electric Power Engineering, which is a unit of State Nuclear Power Technology, penned an engineering, procurement and construction contract after winning three out of the four tenders for the ADB-200 project last December to build a transmission line with a length of 360 kilometers, public data show.

Fengfan secured two other overseas tenders last week. It will provide China Electric Power Equipment and Technology, a contractor of another power transmission project in Pakistan, with CNY114 million worth of tower equipment. Fengfan also penned a USD30 million contract with Chile's Tranmisora del Pacifico regarding transmission lines crossing the Chacao Channel. The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022.
