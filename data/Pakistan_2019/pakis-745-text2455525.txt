Title: Chinese in Pakistan

Snippet: THE all-weather friendship with China Pakistan's largest trading partner has both positive and negative impacts on our society and culture.

There is no doubt that China-Pakistan Economic Corridor will lead Pakistan to socio-economic progress. Owing to this mega project, the number of Chinese nationals has been increasing in Pakistan. But their negative activities cannot be overlooked.

Body: 
Last year, a number of Chinese nationals were involved in cyber crime in Karachi. Recently, two Chinese nationals were arrested in Faisalabad on the charge of trafficking girls to China by contracting marriages.

Such activities should be taken seriously by the government.
