Title: Pakistan to Export Large Quantity of Rice to China, Sign FTA Soon

Snippet: China has offered $1 billion duty-free incentive package to Pakistan and under this arrangement, 150,000 tons of sugar has already been exported and 200,000 tons of rice will be exported by June this year informed Abdul Razak Dawood advisor to the prime minister on Commerce, Textile and Industry.

The prices of yarn would increase and local industry will get affected as the result of such high volume of exports, said Chairman of the committee, Mirza Muhammad Afridi sharing his concerns on the package deal.

Body: 
Textile sector exports would now go up as the result of industries operating optimally and also closed factories have also started productions said, Mirza.

Free trade Agreement (FTA) that allows duty-free market share will be signed between Pakistan and China on the upcoming visit of Prime Minister to the neighboring country said, Abdul Razak Dawood who will also accompany premier on his visit to China. FTA is already enjoyed by the Association of East Asian Nations (ASEAN) from China.

Also, a point was raised by Senator Nauman Wazir that it should be clarified that non-tariff barriers on imports will not be imposed. It was assured by Dawood that we have already taken into confidence the China official for this but this will be again assured.
