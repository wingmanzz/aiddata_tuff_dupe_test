He said Pakistan was looking towards China to give it technological assistance to modernise agriculture.

Mian Kashif said despite all the challenges the incumbent government was working hard to attract investment to the country. He stressed the industrial sector to use cutting-edge technology to enhance their capacity and quality which would lead to increase in exports.

He said there was vast scope for Chinese entrepreneurs for direct investment in FIEDMC and all foreign and local investors were being offered an excellent package of incentives for establishment of industries.

He said the industrial estate was located in close proximity of motorway. He said that both Prime Minister Imran Khan and Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar had given a mandate to him to attract potential investors to FIEDMC and he was endeavouring to come up to their expectations.
