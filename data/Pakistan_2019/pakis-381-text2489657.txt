ATHLETICS:

ATH--WORLDS-DOHA TO TOKYO

DOHA, Qatar _ If the goal of these track and field world championships was to find a fresh face, a vibrant personality, a one-of-a-kind talent to fill the void left by Usain Bolt's absence, then consider this a work in progress. By Eddie Pells and Pat Graham. SENT: 950 words, photos.

SOCCER:

SOC--PLATINI'S COMEBACK

NYON, Switzerland _ Four years after a ban for financial wrongdoing thwarted his chances of becoming FIFA president, Michel Platini is free to work in soccer again on Tuesday.

SOC--ENGLAND-GRADI RETIRES

CREWE, England _ One of the longest-serving managers in English soccer has announced his retirement, three years after he was suspended by the Football Association while it conducted an investigation into a sex-abuse scandal.

SOC--GERMANY-WEEKEND WATCH

BERLIN _ Bayern Munich's first loss of the season has exposed old problems that a 7-2 rout of Tottenham had helped cover up only days before. After producing the seven-goal gala in London in the Champions League on Tuesday, Bayern might have expected more of the same against modest Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga on Saturday. By Ciarán Fahey. SENT: 550 words, photos.

SOC--ITALY-WEEKEND WATCH

MILAN _ Juventus has a new coach and a new style of play. There might have been a feeling of déjà vu in Sunday's Derby d'Italia, which saw Juventus win 2-1 at Inter Milan: Gonzalo Higuain scored a late winner — just as he did at San Siro in 2018 — and eight-time defending champion Juventus moved to the top of the Serie A standings. By Daniella Matar. SENT: 600 words, photos.

SOC--FRANCE-LLORIS

PARIS _ France and Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris is unlikely to play again this year. Lloris sustained a dislocated left elbow early in Tottenham's 3-0 loss at Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday, when he landed awkwardly after falling backward to the ground. SENT: 250 words, photos.

SOC--ITALY-MANCINI

FLORENCE, Italy _ Italy's squad for next year's European Championship will look much the same as the one used in qualifying, coach Roberto Mancini said Monday, denting the hopes of players such as Mario Balotelli.

TENNIS:

TEN--SHANGHAI MASTERS

SHANGHAI _ Andy Murray continued to make progress in his comeback from injury by winning his first-round match at the Shanghai Masters on Monday.

CRI--PAKISTAN-SRI LANKA

LAHORE, Pakistan _ Sri Lanka's inexperienced team earned another emphatic 35-run victory over top-ranked Pakistan in the second Twenty20 on Monday for an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

CRI--ENGLAND-COACH

After four years with an Australian in charge, England's cricket team is back in the hands of an Englishman. Chris Silverwood, who played six tests for England over six years around the turn of the century, was the rather low-profile choice to replace Trevor Bayliss as head coach of the national teams on Monday.

WASHINGTON _ Jay Gruden is fired as coach of the Redskins after an 0-5 start. This was his sixth season with Washington, with one playoff appearance to show for it. By Howard Fendrich and Stephen Whyno. SENT: 600 words, photos.
