"Through effective measures, the government has successfully prevented the theft of Rs40 billion worth of electricity," he said.He said that cases have also been registered against those involved in gas and electricity theft.

Fawad also lashed out at the opposition leaders over alleged money laundering. He said that details of corruption were coming to fore from Punjab.

"It has been confirmed that the Hudaibiya pattern of money laundering had been used by Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari who are the central characters of the money laundering system in the country. There are dozens of secondary characters as well who have been working as their front-end," he said.
