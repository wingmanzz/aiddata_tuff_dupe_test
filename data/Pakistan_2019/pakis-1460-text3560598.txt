Title: In China: Foreign investment efforts need more impetus

Snippet: Concrete efforts are needed to further optimise the foreign investment environment in China amid rising global uncertainties, a new report said on Tuesday.

From 2008 to 2018, China's business environment index for foreign investment was in the top 10 among a sample of 30 countries and regions, said the Report on Foreign Investment Development in China 2019 released by the Institute of International Economy at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.

Body: 
'The business environment for foreign investment has continued to improve, but uncertainties have increased,' said the ninth edition of the annual academic research. Li Yumei, a professor at the institute and a major participant of the report, said, 'Overall, China's business environment is expected to ensure relatively stable foreign direct investment in the future.'

The Sino-US trade friction is hampering the flow of foreign capital into China's high-tech industries. But such an impact is still relatively small, she said.
