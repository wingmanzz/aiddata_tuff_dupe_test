Title: FIA arrests Chinese nationals allegedly involved in human trafficking

Body: 
Recently, the FIA conducted an intelligence-based operation and arrested a Chinese groom from a wedding ceremony in Faisalabad. The agency believes a Chinese gang with the help of Pakistani facilitators is involved in human trafficking and illegal organ harvesting.

According to the FIA, the suspects con Pakistani families by marrying girls with the help of local agents. Insiders revealed that Christian women were subjected to sexual exploitation after being trafficked to China soon after their 'fake' marriage.

The FIA has launched a crackdown across Punjab and at least 13 Chinese nationals have been arrested so far.

Earlier today, Federal Minister for Interior Brigadier (retd) Ijaz Ahmad Shah took notice of the matter directed concerned departments to take action on the matter immediately.
