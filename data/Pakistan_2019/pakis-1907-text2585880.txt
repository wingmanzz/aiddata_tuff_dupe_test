Title: CPEC to help improve Pakistan's connectivity with the world: finance minister

Snippet: ISLAMABAD, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister Asad Umar said on Wednesday that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will help his country improve its connectivity with the regional countries and beyond to south and central Asia.

Addressing a ceremony in the capital city of Pakistan, Umar said that CPEC is the most important component of China's Belt and Road initiative.

"I believe that CPEC will be the center of gravity of the global trade in the future," Umar said.

He said that Pakistan is also working on a plan to bring forward other parties to invest in various projects along the CPEC route to accelerate economic activities and increase jobs for the youth.

Terming CPEC as the best example of Pakistan-China friendship, the finance minister said that the project is equally important for other countries of the region and hoped that someday neighboring countries will look beyond their immediate interests and join Pakistan and China in the CPEC.
