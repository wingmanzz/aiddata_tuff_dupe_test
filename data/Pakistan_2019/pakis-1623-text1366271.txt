Title: Gwadar is not for sale, says Bhootani

Snippet: Member National Assembly Aslam Bhootani slammed the federal government for neglecting Gwadar's public representatives during the Saudi prince's visit. He said Gwadar is not for sale and

no one would be allowed to sell its resources.

Body: 
'Without taking the elected public representatives of Gwadar into confidence all mega development projects in Gwadar are meaningless,' said Bhootani the elected MNA from Gwadar while speaking in a National Assembly session.

He added previously the port city was sold to Singapore then China and now attempts are under way to sell Gwadar to the Saudis.

He stressed that any agreement won't be accepted till the federal government takes public representatives on board.

'The Chinese investment of $62 billion didn't provide any relief to the people of Gwadar and now the Centre is distracting us over Saudi investment,' the MNA said and added he would personally meet Saudi ambassador and share his reservations.
