As a breakthrough in technological cooperation between emerging markets, it marks the first instance of Chinese securities technology system going global, a victory won by SZSE in the fierce international competition with global top suppliers.

According to the agreement, SZSE, based on its latest independently-developed trading and surveillance system and the actual development of Pakistan's capital market will upgrade the existing PSX trading system and build a market surveillance system for PSX.

The new system will significantly improve PSX's safe operation capacity, market operation efficiency, and risk control, further enhance the competitiveness and influence of PSX in the region, and lay a more solid foundation for the development and expansion of Pakistan's capital market.
